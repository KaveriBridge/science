## The Shapes of Carbon Compounds
* The tetravalence of carbon and the formation of covalent bonds by it are explained in terms of its electronic configuration and the hybridisation of s and p orbitals. 


## PI and Sigma bonds

|Characterstic | Sigma Bond | pi bond |
|-|-|-|
|Notation | σ  bond | π  bond
|Orbitals overlap | End-to-end | Side-by-side |
|Electron density | Between the nuclei | Above and below the plane of nuclei |
|Reactivity| Less reactive | More reactive |

## Hybridisation
* Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds.

### Hybrid orbitals in common compounds
|Compound | Orbitals |
|-|-|
|Methane | sp³ hybrid |
|Ethene | sp² hybrid |
|Ethyne | sp hybrid |

### Hybridization and electronegativity
* The greater the s character of the hybrid orbitals, the greater is the electronegativity.
* A carbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with 50% s character is more electronegative than that possessing sp² or sp³ hybridised orbitals.

### sp hybrid orbital 
* Contains more s character and hence it is closer to its nucleus 
* Forms shorter and stronger bonds than the sp³ hybrid orbital.

### sp² hybrid orbital
* Intermediate in s character between sp and sp³
* Length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate between them.

## Carbon bonds characterstics

|Characterstic | Single Bond | Double bond | Triple bond |
|-|-|-|-|
|σ bond (number) | 1 | 1 | 1
|σ bond hybrid | sp³ | sp² | sp 
|π  bond | 0 | 1 | 2
|Reactivity | Stable | Less stable | Least stable |
