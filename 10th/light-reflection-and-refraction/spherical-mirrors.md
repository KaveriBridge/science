## Introduction
* The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror. 
* **Spherical Mirror**: A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors with spherical reflecting surfaces are called spherical mirrors.

## Concave vs Convex Mirror
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards. 
* **Concave Mirror**: A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
* **Convex Mirror**: A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror.

### Pole
* The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror
* Lies on the surface of the mirror
* Usually represented by the letter P.

### Centre of Curvature
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere. 
* The centre of this sphere is a point called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. 
* Represented by the letter C.

#### Where does it lie?
* It is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting surface. 
* Concave Mirror: Lies in front of the concave mirror.
* Convex Mirror:  Lies behind of the convex mirror.

### Radius of Curvature
* The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. 
* Represented by the letter R. 
* The distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. 

### Principal axis
* An imaginary line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror. 
* The pincipal axis is normal to the mirror at its pole. 

### Principal Focus
* A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a spherical mirror. 
* Observe the reflected rays.

* In case of a concave mirror, the reflected rays are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the mirror.

* In case of a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to come from a point on the principal axis. 
* This point is called the principal focus of the mirror. 
* The principal focus is represented by the letter F. 

### Focal length
* The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length. 
* Represented by the letter f

### Aperture
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by and large spherical.
* The surface, then, has a circular outline. 
* The diameter of the reflecting surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture.

* The distance MN represents the aperture

### radius of curvature R, and focal length f
* R = 2f
* The principal focus (F) of a spherical mirror lies midway between the pole (P) and centre of curvature (C)

## Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors
### Ray Diagrams
#### Ray parallel to the principal axis

A ray parallel to the principal axis, after reflection, will pass through the principal focus in case of a concave mirror or appear to diverge from the principal focus in case of a convex mirror.

#### Ray passing through to the principal focus
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209050-6374a341-9da3-4297-9980-325348825b20.png">
A ray passing through the principal focus of a concave mirror or a ray which is directed towards the principal focus of a convex mirror, after reflection, will emerge parallel to the principal axis. 

#### Ray passing through to the centre of curvature
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209094-7e2224c3-e5a3-406d-87f6-f6d0f6d84082.png">
A ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or directed in the direction of the centre of curvature of a convex mirror, after reflection, is reflected back along the same path. The light rays come back along the same path because the incident rays fall on the mirror along the normal to the reflecting surface  

#### Ray incident obliquely to the principal axis towards at the pole of the mirror
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209128-ed2c65bf-4d91-43f3-82d2-9e868425db69.png">
A ray incident obliquely to the principal axis, towards a point P (pole of the mirror), on the concave mirror or a convex mirror, is reflected obliquely. The incident and reflected rays follow the laws of reflection at the point of incidence (point P), making equal angles with the principal axis.
