## Coal and Petroleum
    Coal
        Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived millions of years ago. 
        These were crushed into the earth, perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 
        They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. 
        They slowly decayed into coal. 

    Oil and gas
        Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. 
        When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. 
        Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. 
        Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. 
        The oil and gas seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. 

## Oxidation
    Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate oxidise alcohols to acids. 
    Oxidation of Ethanol
        Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube.
        Warm it gently in a water bath.
        Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate drop by drop to this solution.
        The colour of potassium permanganate disappears initially.
        The colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added.

## Addition Reaction
    Addition
        Unsaturated hydrocarbons
        Add hydrogen
        In presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel
        To give saturated hydrocarbons

    Catalysts
        cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate
        without the reaction itself being affected

    Hydrogenation
        Addition of hydrogen to vegetable oils 
            Using a nicket catalyst
            produces saturated fats

    Saturated/Unsaturated fats and health        
        Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains
        Animal fats have saturated carbon chains    
        Saturated fats are harmul for health
        Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.
