## Common methods 
The common techniques used for purification are as follows :
* (i) Sublimation
* (ii) Crystallisation
* (iii) Distillation
* (iv) Differential extraction and
* (v) Chromatography

### Sublimation
* Some solid substances change from solid to vapour state without passing through liquid state. 
* The purification technique based on the above principle is known as sublimation 
* Used to separate sublimable compounds from nonsublimable impurities

### Crystallisation
* Most commonly used technique
* Based on the difference in the solubilities of the compound and the impurities in a suitable solvent. 
* The impure compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it is sparingly soluble at room temperature but appreciably soluble at higher temperature.
* The solution is concentrated to get a nearly saturated solution. 
* On cooling the solution, pure compound crystallises out and is removed by filtration. 
* The filtrate (mother liquor) contains impurities and small quantity of the compound. 
* If the compound is highly soluble in one solvent and very little soluble in another solvent, crystallisation can be satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these
solvents. 
* Impurities, which impart colour to the solution are removed by adsorbing over activated charcoal. 
* Repeated crystallisation becomes necessary for the purification of compounds containing impurities of comparable solubilities.
