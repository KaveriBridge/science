* Lipids are generally water insoluble. 
* They could be simple fatty acids. 

## Fatty acids
* R-COOH 
* COOH → carboxyl group
* R → methyl (–CH₃), or ethyl (–C₂H₅) or higher number of –CH₂ groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). 
* Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds).

## Glycerides 
* They are esters of glycerol and fatty acids
* They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. 
* These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. 
* Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. 

## Phospholipids
* Lipids with phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
* They are found in cell membrane. 
* Example: Lecithin
