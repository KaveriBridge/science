## What is in Living organisms?
* Living organisms have a higher percentage of carbon and hydrogen than non-living matter.

## Amino acids
* Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH₂) and carboxylate (−COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.

* The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. 
* Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. 
* Aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan

* A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

### Types of amino acids
* Number of amino acids that occur in proteins are only of twenty types. 

|Name | R group | Description | 
|-|-|-|
|Glycine | Hydrogen (-H) |
|Alanine | Methyl (-CH₃)|
|Serine  | Hydroxy methyl (-CH₂-OH)|
|Lysine  | Lysl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) | Basic |

## Lipids

* Lipids are generally water insoluble. 
* They could be simple fatty acids. 

### Fatty acids
* A fatty acid has a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to an R group. 
* The R group could be a methyl (–CH₃), or ethyl (–C₂H₅) or higher number of –CH₂ groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). 
* For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. 
* Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. 
* Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds).

### Glycerol
* Trihydroxy propane.

### Glycerides 
* They are esters of glycerol and fatty acids
* They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. 
* These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. 
#### Fats and Oils
* Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. 

### Phospholipids
* Lipids with phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
* They are found in cell membrane. 
* Example: Lecithin

## DNA and RNA
* Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. 
### Nitrogen bases
* Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. 
### Nucleosides
* When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. 
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 
### Nucleotides
* If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. 
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. 
* DNA and RNA function as genetic material.
