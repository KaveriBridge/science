## p-n junction
* The basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor, etc.
## 14.5.1 p-n junction formation
* Consider a thin silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. 
* The wafer contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region. 
* Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: diffusion and drift. 

### Diffusion
* N-type semiconductor has higher concentration of electrons. 
* P-type semiconductor has higher concentration of holes.
* Due to concentration gradient, holes diffuse from p → n and electrons diffuse from n → p.
* This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction. 
* When an electron diffuses from n → p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side. 
* This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms. 
* As the electrons continue to diffuse from n → p, a layer of positive charge on n-side of the junction is developed
