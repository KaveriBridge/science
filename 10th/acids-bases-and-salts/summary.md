### Acid-base indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the presence of acids and bases.
### Acidic nature of a substance is due to the formation of H+(aq) ions in solution.
### Formation of OHâ€“(aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic nature of a substance.
### When an acid reacts with a metal, hydrogen gas is evolved and a corresponding salt is formed.
### When a base reacts with a metal, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas a salt is formed which has a negative ion composed of the metal and oxygen.
### When an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate, it gives the corresponding salt, carbon dioxide gas and water.
### Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce hydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively.
