Q. A positive hole in a semiconductor is
(A) An antiparticle of an electron
(B) A vacancy created when an electron leaves a covalent bond
(C) Absence of free electrons

KCET 1997
Q. Serious drawback of the semiconductor device is:
(A)they cannot be used with high voltage
(B)they pollute the environment
(C)they are costly
(D)they do not last for a long time

Solution: The semiconductor devices do not work at high voltage. The conductivity of semiconductors is affected by the varying voltage of the semiconductor device (it means the resistivity of the semiconductor devices decreases with an increase in temperature). Hence, this type of drawback is a serious drawback of semiconductors.

(A)a semiconductor only
(B)either a semiconductor or an insulator

(A)extrinsic
(B)intrinsic
(C)n-type
(D)p-type.
Solution:

KCET 1997
Q. At 0K temperature, a p-type semiconductor
(A)does not have any charge carriers
(B)has few holes but no free electrons
(C)has few holes and few free electrons
(D)has an equal number of holes and free electrons
Solution: At 0K temperature, a pure semiconductor behaves as an insulator, because it has a few holes in its valence band. But there is no free electron in this state.

KCET 2020
Q. Silicon doped with gallium forms
(A)n-type semiconductor
(B)both n-type and p-type semiconductors
(C)an intrinsic semiconductor
(D)p-type semiconductor

Solution: An intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor where we do not use any dopant, i.e. it is an undoped semiconductor.

Silicon has 4 valence electrons whereas gallium has only 3 valence electrons. Thus, the dopant has less number of valence electrons in this case. Hence, silicon doped with gallium forms a p-type semiconductor.

KCET 2014
Q. In an n-type semiconductor, electrons are majority charge carriers but it does not show any negative charge. The reason is
(A)electrons are stationary
(B)electrons neutralize with holes
(C)mobility of electrons is extremely small
(D)atom is electrically neutral

Solution: The n-type semiconductor consists of pure semiconductor atoms and pentavalent dopant atoms. The atoms are electrically neutral as they have same number of electrons and protons. Hence the n-type semiconductor has neutral charge.

AIEEE 2012
Q. This question has Statement 1 and Statement 2. 
Of the four choices given after the statements, choose the one that best describes the two statements.
Statement 1: A pure semiconductor has negative temperature coefficient of resistance.
Statement 2: On raising the temperature, more charge carriers are released into the conduction band.

(A)Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.
(B)Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.
(C)Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 2 is not a correct explanation of Statement 1.
(D)Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 2 is the correct explanation of Statement 1.

Solution:
In a pure semiconductor, charge carriers are released into the conduction band with the increase in temperature. Because of this, it has negative temperature coefficient of resistance. 

KCET 1998
Q. Minority carriers present in a p-type semiconductor are due to
(A)bias voltage
(B)thermal agitation
(C)addition of impurities
(D)ionisation of impurities

KCET 2006
Q. To a germanium crystal, an equal number of aluminium and indium atoms are added. Then
(A)it remains an intrinsic semiconductor
(B)it becomes an n-type semiconductor
(C)it becomes a p-type semiconductor
(D)it becomes an insulator

Solution: Both aluminium and indium are trivalent. If a trivalent impurity is added to a pure germanium crystal, it forms a p-type semiconductor. 

KCET 2010
Q. In a p-n junction diode not connected to any circuit, 
(A)the potential is the same everywhere
(B)the p-type side has a higher potential than the n-type side
(C)there is an electric field at the junction directed from the n-type side to p-type side
(D)there is an electric field at the junction directed from the p-type side to n-type side
Solution: At the junction, a depletion layer is formed with n-side at higher potential and p-side at lower potential. Therefore, there is an electric field at the junction directed from the n-side to p -side.

KCET 2007
Q. Minority carriers in a p-type semiconductor are
(A)Holes
(B)Free electrons
(C)Both holes and free electrons

Q. When an n-type semiconductor is heated
(A)number of electrons increases while that of holes decreases
(B)number of holes increases while that of electrons decreases
(C)number of electrons and holes remain the same
(D)the number of electrons and holes increases equally.
Solution: When any semiconductor (p-type, n-type or intrinsic) is heated, free electrons are generated. At the same time, a hole is also produced. Hence the number of electrons and holes increases equally.

KCET 2017
Q. The energy gap in the case of which of the following is less than 3eV?
(A)Copper
(B)Iron
(C)Aluminium
(D)Germanium
Solution:

The energy gap of most semiconductors is nearly 1.1eV which is less than 3eV. As we know germanium is a semiconductor and its energy gap is 0.67eV. Thus germanium is the right answer.

KCET 2005
Q. Identify the property which is not a characteristic of a semiconductor?
(A)at very low temperatures, it behaves like an insulator
(B)at higher temperatures, two types of charge carriers will cause conductivity
(C)The charge carriers are electrons and holes in the valence band at higher temperatures
(D)the semiconductor is electrically neutral
Solution: At higher temperatures, electrons cross the energy gap and reach the conduction band. Hence statement (C) is wrong.

(A)Germanium is doped with bismuth
(B)Silicon is doped with antimony
(C)Germanium is doped with gallium
(D)Silicon is doped with phosphorus

Solution: A p-type semiconductor is obtained when a pure semiconductor is doped with trivalent atoms. Gallium is a trivalent element, hence germanium doped with gallium produces a p-type semiconductor.
