## Introduction
* The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror. 
* **Spherical Mirror**: A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors with spherical reflecting surfaces are called spherical mirrors.

## Concave vs Convex Mirror
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards. 
* **Concave Mirror**: A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
* **Convex Mirror**: A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror.

### Pole
* The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror
* Lies on the surface of the mirror
* Usually represented by the letter P.

### Centre of Curvature
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere. 
* The centre of this sphere is a point called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. 
* Represented by the letter C.

#### Where does it lie?
* It is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting surface. 
* Concave Mirror: Lies in front of the concave mirror.
* Convex Mirror:  Lies behind of the convex mirror.

### Radius of Curvature
* The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. 
* Represented by the letter R. 
* The distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. 

### Principal axis
* An imaginary line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror. 
* The pincipal axis is normal to the mirror at its pole. 

### Principal Focus
* A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a spherical mirror. 
* Observe the reflected rays.

* In case of a concave mirror, the reflected rays are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the mirror.

* In case of a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to come from a point on the principal axis. 

* This point is called the principal focus of the mirror. 
* The principal focus is represented by the letter F. 

### Focal length
* The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length. 
* Represented by the letter f

### Aperture
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by and large spherical.
* The surface, then, has a circular outline. 
* The diameter of the reflecting surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture.

* The distance MN represents the aperture

### radius of curvature R, and focal length f
* R = 2f
* The principal focus (F) of a spherical mirror lies midway between the pole (P) and centre of curvature (C)

## Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors
### Concave Mirror
|Position of the object| Position of the image|Size of the image| Nature of the image|
|-|-|-|-|
|At infinity| At the focus F |Highly diminished, point-sized | Real and inverted
|Beyond C |Between F and C |Diminished |Real and inverted
|At C |At C |Same size |Real and inverted
|Between C and F |Beyond C |Enlarged |Real and inverted
|At F |At infinity | Highly enlarged |Real and inverted
|Between P and F |Behind the mirror |Enlarged |Virtual and erect

### Convex Mirror
|Position of the object| Position of the image|Size of the image| Nature of the image|
|-|-|-|-|
|At infinity| At the focus F, behind the mirror |Highly diminished, point-sized | Virtual and erect
|Between infinity and the pole P |Between P and F, behind the mirror |Diminished| Virtual and erect

|Origin|The pole (P) of the mirror

|Object| Always placed to the left of the mirror. 
|Distance | All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror
|Distance sign |  Distances measured to the right of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as positive <br>
                  Distances measured to the left of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as negative <br> 
                  Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along + y-axis) are taken as positive. <br>
                  Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along â€“y-axis) are taken as negative.
