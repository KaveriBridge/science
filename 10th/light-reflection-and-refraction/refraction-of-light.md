Light seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium.
What happens when light enters from one transparent medium to another? 
Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its direction? 
We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.
You might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised. 
Similarly, when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. 
Why does it happen? 
Have you seen a pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? 
It appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water. 
You might have observed that a lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides. 
How can you account for such experiences?

Let us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil, partly immersed in water. 
The light reaching you from the portion of the pencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared to the part above water. 
This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at the interface. 
For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it

## Laws of refraction of light
(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of
refraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90)

## Snell's law
If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then, 
sin i / sin r = constant
This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.

## 10.3.2 The Refractive Index
* You have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium. 
* The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index, the “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(10.4).
* The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity, the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. 
* It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. 
* Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1. 
* In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. 
* It reduces considerably in glass or water. 
* The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as given below
* Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.10.11. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the speed of light in medium 2. 
* The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2. 
* This is usually represented by the symbol n21
* n21 = Speed of light in medium 1 / Speed of light in medium 2 = v1/v2
* By the same argument, the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12.
* n12 = Speed of light in medium 2 / Speed of light in medium 1 = v2/v1
* If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum.
* This is called the absolute refractive index of the medium. It is simply represented as n2.
* If c is the speed of light in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive index of the medium nm is given by
* nm = Speed of light in air/Speed of light in the medium = c/v
* The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive index. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 10.3. From
the Table you can know that the refractive index of water, nw = 1.33. This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of light in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown
glass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you need not memorise the data.
