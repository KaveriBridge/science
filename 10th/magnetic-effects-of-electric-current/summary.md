## Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
* In 1820, he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
* Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. 
* The unit of magnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.


## Compass needle
* A compass needle is a small magnet. 
* The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards north and south directions. 
* The end pointing towards north is called north seeking or north pole. 
* The other end that points towards south is called south seeking or south pole. 
* Like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other

## Magnetic field and field lines
* A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected.
* It has both direction and magnitude.

### Field lines
* Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. 
* A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. 
* The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take. 
* Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater.
* Magnetic field lines are closed curves.
* They emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole 
* Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. 
* The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. 
* The field is stronger, that is, the force acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded 
* No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.

### Strength of the magnetic field
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it.


### Right-Hand Thumb Rule
<img width="480" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/152538105-8a3fb65d-3567-45e2-9fcb-e790c72193ba.png">

* Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. 
* Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field
* This is known as the right-hand thumb rule
* Also known as "Maxwell’s corkscrew rule"

## Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop
* We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines produced around a current-carrying straight wire. 
* Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it. 
* How would the magnetic field lines look like? 
* We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it. 
* Similarly at every point of a current-carrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move
away from the wire 
* By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. 
* Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. 
* By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop
* We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
* Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. 
* This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up.

## Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid
* A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. 
* The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.
* One end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the south pole. 
* The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. 
* Magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. It is uniform inside the solenoid.

## Electromagnet
* An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire.

## FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
* A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.
* If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule. 
* This is the basis of an electric motor.

### Fleming left hand rule

* According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular. 
* If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or
the force acting on the conductor



n A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.
The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction
is given by the right-hand rule.
n The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current
flowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor.

n 
An electric motor is a device that converts electric energy into mechanical energy.
n The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced current
in a coil placed in a region where the magnetic field changes with time. The magnetic
field may change due to a relative motion between the coil and a magnet placed
near to the coil. If the coil is placed near to a current-carrying conductor, the
magnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the
conductor or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. The
direction of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s right-hand rule.
n A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It works on the basis
of electromagnetic induction.
n In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One
of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of
black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two
is 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected
to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that
any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.
n Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to
short-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.
