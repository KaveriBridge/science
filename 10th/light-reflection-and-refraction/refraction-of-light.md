## What is refraction?
* A ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium.

## Effects of refraction
* The bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised
* Letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it
* When a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. 
* A pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water.  
* A lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides.

## Laws of refraction of light
* The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
* The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media.  (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90)

## Snell's law of refraction
If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then, 
* sin i / sin r = constant 
* This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.

## Speed of light in various media
* Light propagates with different speeds in different media. 
* Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×10⁸ ms⁻¹.
* In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. 
* It reduces considerably in glass or water. 

## The Refractive Index
## Relative refractive index
* The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2.

### Absolute refractive index
* The refractive index of a transparent medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to that in the medium.

## Optical density and speed of light
* The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.
* When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? 
* In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. 
* The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.
* The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium. 
* Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. 
* When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.
