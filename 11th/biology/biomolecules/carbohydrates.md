# Carbohydrates
* Polysaccharides - long chains of sugars
* Monosaccharides are the building block.

## Examples
### Cellulose
* A polymeric polysaccharide 
* A homopolymer of glucose
* Plant cell walls are made of cellulose
### Starch
* Glucose polymer - store house of energy in plant tissues. 
* Starch forms helical secondary structures
. Starch can hold I₂  molecules in the helical portion. The starch-I₂  is blue in colour. 
### Glycogen
* Glucose polymer in animals
* In a polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. 
### Inulin 
* Polymer of fructose. 
### Chitin
* Exoskeletons of arthropods
* A complex polysaccharide
