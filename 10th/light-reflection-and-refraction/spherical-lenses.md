## Introduction
## What is a lens?
* A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. 
* A lens is bound by at least one spherical surface. The other could be plane. 

## Convex Lens
* A lens may have two spherical surfaces, bulging outwards. 
* Such a lens is called a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex lens. 
* It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges. 
* Convex lens converges light rays as shown in the figure and hence called converging lenses.

## Concave Lens
* A double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces, curved inwards. 
* A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens
* It is thicker at the edges than at the middle. 
* Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in the figure and hence called diverging lenses.

### Optical centre
* The central point of a lens is its optical centre
* Usually represented by the letter O.
* A ray of light through the optical centre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. 

### Centre of Curvature
* A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens, has two spherical surfaces. 
* Each of these surfaces forms a part of a sphere. 
* The centres of these spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens. 
* The centre of curvature of a lens is usually represented by the letter C. 
* Since there are two centres of curvature, we may represent them as C₁  and C₂

### Radius of Curvature
* The radius of the sphere of which the spherical surface of a spherical lens forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the lens. 
* Represented by the letter R. 

### Aperture
* The effective diameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.

### Thin lenses with small apertures
* Aperture is much less than its radius of curvature
* Two centres of curvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. 

### Principal axis
* An imaginary straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is called its principal axis.
* It passes through the optical centre.

### Principal Focus
* A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a spherical lens. 
* Observe the refracted rays.

* In case of a convex lens, the refracted rays are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the lens.

* In case of a convex lens, the refracted rays appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis. 

* This point is called the principal focus of the lens. 
* The principal focus is represented by the letter F. 

* If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you get another principal focus on the opposite side.  Hence, a lens has two principal foci. They
are represented by F₁  and F₂

### Focal length
* The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. 
* Represented by the letter f

### radius of curvature R, and focal length f
* R = 2f
* The principal focus (F) of a spherical lens lies midway between the optical center (O) and the centre of curvature (C).

* A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after refraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus on the other side of the lens. 
* In case of a concave lens, the ray appears to diverge from the principal focus located on the same side of the lens.

## Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Lens
### New Cartesian Sign Convention

|Topic|Convention|
|-|-|
| Origin |The optical centre of the lens
| x-axis |The principal axis of the lens
| Object | Always placed to the left of the lens. 
| Focal length | +ve for a convex lens and -ve for a concave lens
| Distance | All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from optical centre of the lens
| Distance sign |  Distances measured to the right of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as positive <br> Distances measured to the left of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as negative <br> Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along + y-axis) are taken as positive. <br> Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along –y-axis) are taken as negative.

## Lens Formula
<img width="160" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148642903-bc795426-ada2-408e-a4a1-6a728478b57e.png">

* u = object distance = The distance of the object from the optical center
* v = image distance = The distance of the image from the optical center
* f = focal length = The distance of the principal focus from the optical center

## Magnification
* Magnification produced by a spherical lense gives the relative extent to which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.
* Ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. 
* Represented by the letter m

### Formula
* m = Height of the image/ Height of the object = h′/h
* m = h'/h = -v/u

<img width="320" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148642925-f2e33f5c-b8e4-42ed-9652-855b6851cce2.png">

### Sign of the height
* The height of the object is taken to be positive as the object is usually placed above the principal axis. 
* The height of the image should be taken as positive for virtual images. 
* The height of the image should be taken as negative for real images

### Sign of the magnification
* Negative for real images
* Positive for virtual images

## Power of a Lens
* The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. 
* The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length. 
* It is represented by the letter P. 
* The power of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative.

<img width="120" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148642952-3baf24f7-0d59-4053-b35f-b13bd927ce5b.png">

### SI Unit of a Lens
* SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’
* denoted by the letter D.
* 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 
* 1D = 1m⁻¹

### Power of a combination of lenses
* The net power (P) of the lenses placed in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers 
* P = P1  + P2  + P3 + …

* The use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.
* During eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses of known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. 
* The optician calculates the power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. 
* For example, a combination of two lenses of power + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.
* The simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems to minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens. 
* Such a lens system, consisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of camera, microscopes and telescopes

## Questions
#### 1. Define 1 dioptre of power of a lens.
* 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre.
#### 2. A convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance of 50 cm from it. Where is the needle placed in front of the convex lens if the image is equal to the size of the object? Also, find the power of the lens.
* The needle is placed on the center of curvature (2F₁) as the image size is equal to the size of the object.
* Hence the focal length is 50/2 = 25cm
* Power of the lense = 1/f = 1/0.25m = 4m⁻¹
#### 3. Find the power of a concave lens of focal length 2 m.
* Focal length of the concave lens is negative.
* f = -2m
* Power = 1/f = 1/-2 = -0.5m⁻¹
