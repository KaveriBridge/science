## What is refraction?
* Living organisms have a higher percentage of carbon and hydrogen than non-living matter.

## Amino acids
* Amino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and an acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the α-carbon.

* Consists of hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group designated as R group. 
* Based on the nature of R group there are many amino acids. 
* Those which occur in proteins are only of twenty types. 
* The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl
(serine), etc. 
* The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. 
* Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. 
* Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). 
* A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.
