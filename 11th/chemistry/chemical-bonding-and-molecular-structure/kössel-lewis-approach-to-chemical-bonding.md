# 4.1 KÖSSEL-LEWIS APPROACH TO CHEMICAL BONDING
* Based on the inertness of noble gases
* Lewis postulated that atoms achieve the stable octet when they are linked by chemical bonds.
### Lewis symbols
* The number of dots around the symbol represents the number of valence electrons. 
### Kössel observations
* In the periodic table, the highly electronegative halogens and the highly electropositive alkali metals are separated by the noble gases;
* The formation of a negative ion from a halogen atom and a positive ion from an alkali metal atom is associated with the gain and loss of an electron by the respective atoms;
* The negative and positive ions thus formed attain stable noble gas electronic configurations. 
* The noble gases (with the exception of helium which has a duplet of electrons) have a particularly stable outer shell configuration of eight (octet) electrons, ns2np6.
* The negative and positive ions are stabilized by electrostatic attraction.
* The bond formed, as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the positive and negative ions was termed as the electrovalent bond. 
#### Limitations
* Works for ionic compounds, but does not work for other compounds

## 4.1.1 Octet Rule
* Atoms can combine to have an octet (8 electrons) in their outermost shells. 
* Can be achieved by (1) By transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) (2) By sharing of valence electrons
