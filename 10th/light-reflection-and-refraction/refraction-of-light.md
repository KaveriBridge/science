## What is refraction?
* A ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium.
* Refraction is due to change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to another. 

## Effects of refraction
* The bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised
* Letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it
* When a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. 
* A pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water.  
* A lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides.

|Line/Angle|Description|
|-|-|
|EO | Incident ray
|OO' | Refracted ray
|O'H | Emergent ray
|NN' | Normal
|i | Angle of incidence
|r | Angle of refraction

### Refraction - Which side does it bend?
The light ray at point O has entered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to glass. Note that the light ray has bent towards
the normal. At O', the light ray has entered from glass to air, that is, from a denser medium to a rarer medium. The light here has bent away from the normal

### Ray emerges parallel - Why?
The ray emerges parallel to the incident ray. Reason - The extent of bending of the ray of light at the opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface) and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular glass slab is equal and opposite. However, the light ray is shifted sideward slightly.

## Laws of refraction of light
* The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
* The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media.  (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90)

## Snell's law of refraction
If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then, 
* sin i / sin r = constant

* This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.

## Speed of light in various media
* Light propagates with different speeds in different media. 
* Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×10⁸ ms⁻¹.
* In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. 
* It reduces considerably in glass or water. 

## The Refractive Index
## Relative refractive index
* The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2.

### Absolute refractive index
* The refractive index of a transparent medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to that in the medium.

## Optical density and speed of light
* The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.
* When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? 
* In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. 
* The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.
* The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium. 
* Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. 
* When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.


## QUESTIONS
### 1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the light ray bend towards the normal or away from the normal? Why?
* Air is optically rarer as compared to water as it has lower refractive index.
* When a ray of light travels from a rarer medium to a denser medium, it slows down and bends towards the normal. 

### 2. Light enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.50. What is the speed of light in the glass? The speed of light in vacuum is 3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹.
* We know that n = c/v
* Therefore v = c/n
* In this case, c = 3 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹ and n = 1.50
* v = 3 × 10⁸/1.5 = 2 × 10⁸ ms⁻¹.

### 3. Find out, from Table 10.3, the medium having highest optical density. Also find the medium with lowest optical density.
* In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. 
* Diamond with n=2.42 is most optically dense.
* Air with n=1.003 is the least optically dense.


### 4. You are given kerosene, turpentine and water. In which of these does the light travel fastest? 
* The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium.
* Light travels the fastest in water (with n=1.33) as it is optically rarer than kerosene (n=1.44) and turpentine (n=1.47)

### 5. The refractive index of diamond is 2.42. What is the meaning of this statement?
* Light travels 2.42 times slower in Diamond as compared to vaccuum/air.
