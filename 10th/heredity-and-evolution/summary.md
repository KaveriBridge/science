## Introduction
* Reproductive processes produce new individuals with subtle differences
* Asexual reproduction can produce some variation
* Sexual reproduction maximizes the number of successful variations
* Little variation among individual sugarcane plants, but distinct variations among sexually reproducing animals like humans
* This chapter will study the mechanism of creating and inheriting variations, and the long-term consequences of these variations, including evolution

## 9.1 ACCUMULATION OF VARIATION DURING REPRODUCTION
* Inheritance from the previous generation provides a common body design and subtle changes for the next generation
* The second generation will have differences inherited from the first generation and newly created differences
* In asexual reproduction, small differences may be generated due to DNA copying errors, but in sexual reproduction, greater diversity is created through the rules of inheritance
* Not all variations in a species have equal chances of surviving in their environment
* Variations that give an advantage to individuals will be more likely to survive and be passed on
* Selection of variants by environmental factors is the basis for evolutionary processes
