## Amino acids
* Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH₂) and carboxylate (−COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.

* The properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. 
* Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. 
* Aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan

* A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

### Types of amino acids
* Number of amino acids that occur in proteins are only of twenty types. 

|Name | R group | Description | 
|-|-|-|
|Glycine | Hydrogen (-H) |
|Alanine | Methyl (-CH₃)|
|Serine  | Hydroxy methyl (-CH₂-OH)|
|Lysine  | Lysl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) | Basic |

## Proteins and their function
|Protein |Functions|
|-|-|
|Collagen |Intercellular ground substance
