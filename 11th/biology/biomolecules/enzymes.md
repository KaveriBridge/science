# Enzymes
* Enzymes are mostly proteins which catalyse biochemical reactions in the cells.
* Some nucleic acids (Ribozymes) also act as enzymes
* Enzymes lower activation energy of reactions and enhance greatly the rate of the reactions
* Proteinaceous enzymes exhibit substrate specificity, require optimum temperature and pH for maximal activity. 
* Denatured at high temperatures.

## Structure
* The backbone of the protein chain folds upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or pockets are made.
* One such pocket is the ‘active site’
* An active site of an enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. 

### Enzymes vs inorganic catalysts
* Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures 
* Some enzymes isolated from organisms who normally live under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur
springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). 

## Process

E (Enzyme) + S (Substrate) → ES (Enzyme-Substrate Complex) → EP (Enzyme-product complex) → E (Unchanged enzyme) + P (Product)

* Enzymes convert a substrate (S) into a product (P). 
* Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule.
* Substrate ‘S’ binds the enzyme at its ‘active site’ and forms highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES).
* ES complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the unchanged enzyme 
* Enzyme-product complex (EP) is formed in an intermediate stage.

## Catalytic cycle of an enzyme action - Steps
#### The substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting into the active site.
#### The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, fitting more tightly around the substrate.
#### The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed.
#### The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again.


## Progress of a reaction

* Y-axis - Potential energy content. 
* X-axis - Progression of the structural transformation or states through the ‘transition state’. 

#### Activation energy
* The difference in average energy content of ‘S’ from that of the transition state 

# Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
* The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein.
## Temperature and pH
* Function in a narrow range of temperature and pH 
* Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.

* Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. 
* Low temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state
* High temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are **denatured** by heat

## Concentration of Substrate

* Enzymatic reaction's velocity rises, at first, with the increase in substrate concentration.
* The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) 
* Cannot exceed Vmax, as there will be no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules.

## Inhibitors
* Enzymes are sensitive to the presence of specific chemicals that bind to them.
* Inhibitor chemicals shuts off enzyme activity when they bind with them.
* Inhibitors which resemble substrates are called competitive inhibitor. These are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens.

# Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes
Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each with 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number.

### Oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: catalyse oxidoreduction
* Oxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ 
* S reduced + S’ oxidised → S oxidised + S’ reduced.

### Transferases: 
* Transfer of a group, G (other than hydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’
* S - G + S’ → S + S’ - G

### Hydrolases: 
* Hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide, glycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds.

### Lyases: 
* Removal of groups from substrates by mechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.

### Isomerases: 
* Inter-conversion of optical, geometric or positional isomers.

### Ligases
* Linking together of 2 compounds
* Joining of C-O, C-S, C-N, P-O etc. bonds

# Co-factors
* In many cases, a non-protein constituent called cofactor is bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically active. 
* In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the apoenzyme. 
* Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups, co-enzymes and metal ions.
### Prosthetic groups
* Organic compounds tightly bound to the apoenzyme
* Example - In peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme.
### Co-enzymes
* Organic compounds 
* Association with the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of catalysis. 
* Vitamins are essential chemical components of many coenzymes. E.g. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin.

### Metal ions
* A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity 
* They form coordination bonds with side chains at the active site 
* They also form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate.
* E.g., zinc is a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase.
