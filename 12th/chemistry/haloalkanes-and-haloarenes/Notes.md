* The replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in an aromatic hydrocarbon by halogen atom(s) results in the formation of aryl halide (haloarene). 

* Haloalkanes contain halogen atom(s) attached to the sp3 hybridised carbon atom of an alkyl group 
* Haloarenes contain halogen atom(s) attached to sp2 hybridised carbon atom(s) of an aryl group.
