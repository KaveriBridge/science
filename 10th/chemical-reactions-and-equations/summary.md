## 1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction
### Oxidation
* If a substance gains oxygen or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. 
* When a china dish containing copper powder is heated, the surface of the copper powder becomes coated with black copper(II) oxide. 
* This is due to the process of oxidation, in which oxygen is added to the copper and forms copper oxide.
* 2Cu + O₂ → (Heat) → 2CuO

### Reduction
* If a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.
#### Example
* CuO (s) +H₂ (g) → (Heat) → Cu (s) + H₂O (g)
* If hydrogen gas is passed over heated copper oxide, the black coating on the surface turns brown.
* The reverse reaction takes place and copper is obtained.

### Redox 
* During an oxidation-reduction reaction, also known as a redox reaction, one reactant is oxidized (gains oxygen) while the other is reduced (loses oxygen). 
* Redox reactions are important because they involve the transfer of electrons from one reactant to the other.
#### Example
* CuO (s) +H₂ (g) → (Heat) → Cu (s) + H₂O (g)
* Copper(II) oxide is reduced by losing oxygen, while the hydrogen is oxidized by gaining oxygen. 

## 1.3 HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION REACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?
### Corrosion
* Corrosion is a process that causes damage to metal objects, such as car bodies, bridges, iron railings, and ships. 
* It occurs when metals are attacked by substances like moisture and acids
* It is commonly seen as the formation of a reddish-brown powder on iron (rust), or a black coating on silver and a green coating on copper. 
* Corrosion, especially of iron, is a major problem. A large amount of money is spent each year to replace damaged metal.

### Rancidity
* When fats and oils are left for a long time, they can become rancid and change in smell and taste due to the process of oxidation. 
* Antioxidants are often added to foods containing fats and oils to prevent this from happening. 
* To slow down oxidation, it is helpful to store food in airtight containers. 
* Chips manufacturers often use gas such as nitrogen to flush bags of chips and prevent them from becoming oxidized.

## Summary
* A complete chemical equation represents the reactants, products and their physical states symbolically.
* A chemical equation is balanced so that the numbers of atoms of each type involved in a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides of the
equation. Equations must always be balanced.
* In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single substance.
* Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition reaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.
* Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic reactions.
* Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
* When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement reaction occurs.
* Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement reactions.
* Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.
* Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.
* Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. 
* Reduction is the loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen.
