### Specifying state of system and its sorroundings
|  | Description
|-|-|
|System | Specified by  **state functions** or **state variables**
|Sorroundings | Cannot be completely specified

| Variable | Description| Examples|
|-|-|-|
|State function/variable| Depend only on state <br> and not on how it is reached. | Pressure, Volume, Temperature, Internal energy | 
|Path variable |Depends on the path used to reach | Heat, Work|

### Signs (IUPAC vs Physics)
| Type | IUPAC sign | Physics sign|
|-|-|-|
|Work done **by the system** | -ve | +ve|
|Work done **on the system** | +ve | -ve|
|Heat transferred **to the system**|+ve|?|
|Heat transferred **by the system**|-ve|?|

### Reversible vs Irreversible process
#### Reversible process
* The process could, at any moment, be reversed by an infinitesimal change. 
* Proceeds infinitely slowly by a series of equilibrium states 
* The system and the surroundings are always in near equilibrium with each other.

## First Law of Thermodynamic System
* **The energy of an isolated system is constant**
* aka the law of conservation of energy (**energy can neither be created nor be destroyed**)
* **∆U** (change in internal energy) = **q** (heat added to the system) + **w** (work done on the system)

### Enthalpy
* **H** (Enthapy) = **U** (Internal energy) **+ pV** (pressure x volume)
#### Various conditions
|System|Equation|
|-|-|
|Constant pressure (∆p=0) |∆H = ∆U + p∆V |
|Constant volume (∆V=0)|∆H = ∆U |
|Constant temperature (∆T=0) |∆H = ∆U + ∆n<sub>g</sub>RT |

#### ∆H for Exothermic and Endothermic 
|Type of system|∆H|
|-|-|
|Exothermic | Negative (-ve)
|Endothermic | Positive (+ve)

### Types of Reaction enthalpy
|Type|Symbol|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Reaction enthalpy |**∆<sub>r</sub>H**| Enthalpy change of a chemical reaction
|Fusion enthalpy |**∆<sub>fus</sub>H**| Enthalpy change of  melting (solid to liquid)
|Vaporization enthalpy |**∆<sub>vap</sub>H**| Enthalpy change of vaporisation (liquid to gas)
|Sublimation enthalpy |**∆<sub>sub</sub>H**| Enthalpy change of sublimation (solid to gas)
|Formation enthalpy|**∆<sub>f</sub>H**| Enthalpy change for formation of a compound from its elements
|Combustion enthalpy|**∆<sub>c</sub>H**| Enthalpy change during combustion
|Atomization enthalpy|**∆<sub>a</sub>H**| Enthalpy change on breaking bonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas phase
|Bond dissociation enthalpy |**∆<sub>bond</sub>H**| Enthalpy change on breaking a bond
|Mean bond enthalpy|?| Average enthalpy change on breaking a bond, when there are multiple bonds and each bond takes different amounts of energy to break.
|Lattice enthalpy| **∆<sub>lattice</sub>H**| Enthalpy change that occurs when ionic compound dissociates into its ions in gaseous state
|Solution enthalpy|**∆<sub>sol</sub>H**| Enthalpy change that occurs when a substance dissolves in a specified amount of solvent

|Dilution enthalpy | | It is heat withdrawn from the surroundings when additional solvent is added to the solution

#### Standard entalphies
* Enthalpy change for a reaction when all the participating substances are in their standard states 
* Standard pressue - 1 bar pressure
* Standard temperature - 25C or 298K

### Thermochemical Equations
* A balanced chemical equation together with the value of its **∆<sub>r</sub>H** (reaction enthalpy) is called a thermochemical equation.
* Coefficients refers to the number of moles (never molecules) of reactants and products
* Value of ∆<sub>r</sub>H<sup>ϴ</sup> refers to the number of moles of substances specified by the equation
* When a chemical equation is reversed, the value of ∆<sub>r</sub>H<sup>ϴ</sup> is reversed in sign.

### Molar properties
|Type| Formula|
|-|-|
|Molar property | Extensive property value / number of moles 
|Molar volume | Volume / number of moles|
|Molar heat capacity | Heat capacity / number of moles|
|Molar enthalpy H<sub>m</sub> | H / number of moles | 

## Hess’s Law of Constant Heat Summation
* Enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or in a series of steps.
* **If a reaction takes place in several steps then its standard reaction enthalpy is the sum of the standard enthalpies of the intermediate reactions into which the overall reaction may be divided at the same temperature.**
