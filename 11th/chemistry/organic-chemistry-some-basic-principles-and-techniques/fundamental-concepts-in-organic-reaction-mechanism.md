## Organic reaction
* Organic molecule (substrate) + Attacking Reagent → Intermediate(s) → Product(s)

### Reaction mechanism
* A reaction mechanism is the sequence of elementary steps by which a chemical reaction occurs.
* A sequential account of each step, describing details of electron movement, energetics during bond cleavage and bond formation, and the rates of transformation of reactants into products (kinetics) is referred to as reaction mechanism.

## 12.7.1 Fission of a Covalent Bond
A covalent bond can get cleaved either by : (i) heterolytic cleavage, or by (ii) homolytic cleavage.
### Heterolytic cleavage
* In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks in such a fashion that the shared pair of electrons remains with one of the fragments.
### Homolytic cleavage
* In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes with each of the bonded atoms
## 12.7.2 Substrate and Reagent
* In general, a molecule whose carbon is involved in new bond formation is called substrate and the other one is called reagent.
### Nucleophiles and Electrophiles
* A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then called nucleophilic. 
* A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called electrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic.
