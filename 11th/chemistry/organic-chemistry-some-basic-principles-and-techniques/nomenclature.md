# Nomenclature 
### IUPAC system of nomenclature
* IUPAC stands for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
* Systematic method of naming organic compounds
* You can deduce the structure from the name.

### Common names
* Based on the origin or certain properties.
* Example - Citric acid as it is found in citric fruits
* Common names are useful particularly when the alternative systematic names are lengthy and complicated.

# IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes
## Straight chain hydrocarbons: 
* Suffix - ane
* Prefix - indicating the number of carbon atoms present in the chain.

## Branched chain hydrocarbons
#### Step 1: Identify the longest carbon chain. This is also called the parent chain.
#### Step 2: Number the carbon atoms of the parent chain, such that branched carbon atoms get the lowest possible numbers.
#### Step 3: Prefix the names of alkyl groups attached as a branch to the name of the parent alkane. 
* Indicate the position by appropriate numbers. 
* If different alkyl groups are present, list them in alphabetical order.
#### Step 4: Two or more identical substituent groups
* If two or more identical substituent groups are present then the numbers are separated by commas. 
* The names of identical substituents are not repeated, instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri (for 3), tetra (for 4) etc. are used

#### Step 5: Two substituents in equivalent positions
* Give the lower number to the one coming first in the alphabetical listing
#### Step 6: Naming branched alkyl groups
* Name the branched alkyl groups in the same way as the parent chain.
* The carbon atom of the branch that attaches to the root alkane is numbered 1.
* The name of such branched chain alkyl group is placed in parenthesis while naming the compound
#### Multiple chains
* If there happens to be two chains of equal size, then that chain is to be selected which contains more number of side chains.
* After selection of the chain, numbering is to be done from the end closer to the substituent.

## Cyclic Compounds
* Add **cyclo** to the corresponding straight chain alkane name.
