# Nomenclature 
### IUPAC system of nomenclature
* IUPAC stands for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
* Systematic method of naming organic compounds
* You can deduce the structure from the name.

### Common names
* Based on the origin or certain properties.
* Example - Citric acid as it is found in citric fruits
* Common names are useful particularly when the alternative systematic names are lengthy and complicated.

## Methodology - Basic rules
### Identify the principal functional group and substituents
* The principal functional group is used to define the class the compound belongs to e.g. an alcohol, ROH
* The principal functional group is the highest priority functional group. Functional group priority is discussed later.
* The principal functional group is usually given the lowest locant possible.
### Identify the longest continuous chain containing the principal functional group.
* The longest continuous chain containing the principal functional group defines the root name. 
* Other groups attached to this chain are called substituents.
* If there are two chains of equal length, then the choice that gives the simplest substituents is chosen.
### Assign locants (i.e. numbering) to the principal functional group and substituents.
* The numbers that define the positions of the principal functional group and substituents are called locants.
* Compounds are numbered from one end of the longest continuous chain.
* The locants are assigned such that the principal functional group gets the lowest possible locant.
* If this results in a "tie" then the first point of difference rule is applied so that the first time a difference in numbering occurs, then the method that gives the lower number at this first difference is used.
* In the event that there is no first point of difference then alphabetisation is used.

## Terminologies
### Locant
* That part of the name of a compound (often a letter or number) that describes the position of an atom, residue or functional group.
* The 2 in hexan-2-one is a locant.
### Parent chain, branch and functional group

* Parent chain - longest carbon chain
* In a branched chain compound, small chains ofcarbon atoms are attached at one or more carbon atoms of the parent chain. 

### Principal functional group
* Used to define the class the compound belongs to e.g. an alcohol, ROH
* Gives its suffix to the name of the molecule
* Highest priority functional group in a molecule with multiple functional groups

### Longest chain and substituents
* The longest continuous chain containing the principal functional group.
* Other groups attached to this chain are called substituents.

### First point of difference rule
* List out the locant set for each scenario with the locants in numerical order
* Compare the lists looking for the first time the numbers are different
* Pick the scenario with the lower number at the first difference

### Alphabetisation rule
* In constructing the name, substituents are cited in alphabetical order,
* Used only if First point of difference rule does not work.
* For simple substituents (1) multiplier prefixes (di-, tri- tetra- etc.) are ignored (2) prefixes such as neo-, sec-, tert- (or their abbreviations) are ignored (3) the prefixes iso- and cyclo- are included (note they are are used without hyphens and are part of the substituent name)
* For complex substituents, any terms used in the brackets are included. Example: (1,1-dimethylethyl)- is alphabetised as "d

## Alkyl group
* The small carbon chains (branches) are called alkyl groups.
* Replace "ane" of an alkane with "yl"

# IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes
## Straight chain hydrocarbons: 
* Suffix - ane
* Prefix - indicating the number of carbon atoms present in the chain.

## Branched chain hydrocarbons
#### Step 1: Identify the longest carbon chain. This is also called the parent chain.
#### Step 2: Number the carbon atoms of the parent chain, such that branched carbon atoms get the lowest possible numbers.
#### Step 3: Prefix the names of alkyl groups attached as a branch to the name of the parent alkane. 
* Indicate the position by appropriate numbers. 
* If different alkyl groups are present, list them in alphabetical order.
#### Step 4: Two or more identical substituent groups
* If two or more identical substituent groups are present then the numbers are separated by commas. 
* The names of identical substituents are not repeated, instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri (for 3), tetra (for 4) etc. are used

#### Step 5: Two substituents in equivalent positions
* Give the lower number to the one coming first in the alphabetical listing
* Correct name is 3-ethyl-6-methyloctane and not 6-ethyl-3-methyloctane

#### Step 6: Naming branched alkyl groups
* Name the branched alkyl groups in the same way as the parent chain.
* The carbon atom of the branch that attaches to the root alkane is numbered 1.
* The name of such branched chain alkyl group is placed in parenthesis while naming the compound

#### Multiple chains
* If there happens to be two chains of equal size, then that chain is to be selected which contains more number of side chains.
* After selection of the chain, numbering is to be done from the end closer to the substituent.

## Cyclic Compounds
* Add **cyclo** to the corresponding straight chain alkane name.

# Nomenclature of Organic Compounds having Functional Group(s)

### Identify the functional group
* This determines the choice of appropriate suffix
### Numbering of the group
* Choose numbering such that functional group is attached at the carbon atom possessing lowest possible number in the chain.
### Compounds with multiple functional groups
* Polyfunctional compounds
* Choose one functional group as the principal functional group.
* Order of priority: -COOH, –SO₃H, -COOR (R=alkyl group), COCl, -CONH₂, -CN,-HC=O, >C=O, -OH, -NH₂, >C=C<, -C≡C-
* Remaining functional groups are named as substituents using the appropriate prefixes.
* Always prefix substituents : –R, C6H5-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), –NO₂, alkoxy (–OR) 

#### Examples - Compound containing both an alcohol and a keto group
*  Named as hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is preferred to the hydroxyl group.

#### Examples - HOCH₂(CH₂)₃CH2COCH₃
* 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one 
* Not 2-oxoheptan-7-ol
#### Examples - BrCH₂CH=CH₂
* 3-bromoprop-1-ene and not 1-bromoprop-2-ene.
### Compounds with more than one functional group of the same type.
* Adding di, tri, etc. before the class suffix.
* Full name of the parent alkane is written before the class suffix
* Ending – ne of the parent alkane is dropped in the case of compounds having more than one double or triple bond
#### Examples -  CH2(OH)CH2(OH) 
* Ethane–1,2–diol
#### Examples -  CH2=CH-CH=CH2
* Buta–1,3–diene
# Nomenclature of Substituted Benzene Compounds
### Benzene with single substituent
* Place substituent as prefix to the word benzene
* Common names (written in bracket below) of many substituted benzene compounds are also universally used.

### Benzene as a substituent
* Name is phenyl
