## Magnetism due to electricity 
* The electric current through the copper wire produces a magnetic effect. 
* Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric current through a metallic conductor

## Hans Christian Oersted (1777â€“1851)
* In 1820, he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
* Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. 
* The unit of magnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.


## Compass needle
* A compass needle is a small bar magnet. 
* The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards north and south directions. 
* The end pointing towards north is called north seeking or north pole. 
* The other end that points towards south is called south seeking or south pole. 
* Like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other

## Magnetic field and field lines
* Magnetic field has both direction and magnitude.
* Magnetic field lines are closed curves.
* They emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole 
* Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. 
* The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. 
* The field is stronger, that is, the force acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded 
* No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.

### Strength of the magnetic field
* Magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the current through the wire increases.
* Magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases.

* Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. 
* Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field
* This is known as the right-hand thumb rule
