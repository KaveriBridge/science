## What is in Living organisms?
* Living organisms have a higher percentage of carbon and hydrogen than non-living matter.

## Amino acids
* Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH₂) and carboxylate (−COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. 

<img width="320" src="http://www.astrochem.org/sci_img/Amino_Acid_Structure.jpg">

* The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. 
* Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. 
* Aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan

* A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

### Types of amino acids
* Number of amino acids that occur in proteins are only of twenty types. 

|Name | R group | Description | 
|-|-|-|
|Glycine | Hydrogen (-H) |
|Alanine | Methyl (-CH₃)|
|Serine  | Hydroxy methyl (-CH₂-OH)|
|Lysine  | Lysl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) | Basic |

## Lipids

* Lipids are generally water insoluble. 
* They could be simple fatty acids. 

### Fatty acids
* A fatty acid has a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to an R group. 
* The R group could be a methyl (–CH₃), or ethyl (–C₂H₅) or higher number of –CH₂ groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). 
* For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. 
* Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. 
* Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds).

### Glycerol
* Trihydroxy propane.

### Glycerides 
* They are esters of glycerol and fatty acids
* They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. 
* These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. 
* Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. 

### Phospholipids
* Lipids with phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
* They are found in cell membrane. 
* Example: Lecithin

## DNA and RNA

* Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. 
### Nitrogen bases
* Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. 
### Nucleosides
* When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. 
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 
### Nucleotides
* If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. 
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. 
* DNA and RNA function as genetic material.

## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES
### Metabolite
* A metabolite is an intermediate or end product of metabolism. 
### Primary metabolite 
* Directly involved in normal "growth", development, and reproduction. 
* Example - Ethylene 
### Secondary metabolite 
* Not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function. 
* Examples include antibiotics and pigments such as resins and terpenes etc.
* The most exciting aspect of chemistry deals with isolating thousands of compounds, small and big, from living organisms, determining their structure and if possible synthesising them.
* If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. 
* For reasons that are given in section 9.10, we can call these biomolecules as ‘metabolites’. 
* In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. 
* These are called primary metabolites. 
* However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary metabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. 
* These are called secondary metabolites (Table 9.3). 
* While primary metabolites have identifiable functions and play known roles in normal physiologial processes, we do not at the moment, understand the role or functions of all the ‘secondary metabolites’ in host organisms. 
* However, many of them are useful to ‘human welfare’ (e.g., rubber, drugs, spices, scents and pigments). 
* Some secondary metabolites have ecological importance. 
* In the later chapters and years you will learn more about this.


## 9.10 METABOLIC BASIS FOR LIVING

### Metabolic pathway 
* A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions in a cell that build and breakdown molecules for cellular processes.

### Anabolic and Catabolic pathways
* Anabolic pathways synthesize molecules and require energy. Example - Assembly of a protein.
* Catabolic pathways break down molecules and produce energy. Example - Breakdown of glucose to lactic acid
* Enzymes facilitate these chemical reactions.

### ATP
* Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
* Living organisms store energy in the bonds of ATP 
* They use this bond energy for work, when needed.
