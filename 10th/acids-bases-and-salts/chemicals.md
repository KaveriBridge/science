## Sodium hydroxide
* When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. 
* The process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
* 2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)
* Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode. 
* Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. 
* The three products produced in this process are all useful. 
* Figure 2.8 shows the different uses of these products.
## Bleaching powder
* Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. 
* Bleaching powder is represented as CaOCl2, though the actual composition is quite complex.
* Ca(OH)2 + Cl2 → CaOCl2 + H2O
### Bleaching powder is used –
* (i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry
* (i) for bleaching wood pulp in paper factories
* (i) for bleaching washed clothes in laundry
* (ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries
* (iii) to make drinking water free from germs.


## Baking soda
* The chemical name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). 
* It is produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.
* NaCl + H2O + CO2 + NH3 → NH4Cl (Ammonium chloride) + NaHCO3 (Sodium hydrogencarbonate)
* It is a mild non-corrosive basic salt. 
* The following reaction takes place when it is heated during cooking –
* 2NaHCO3 (Sodium hydrogencarbonate) → (Heating)→ Na2CO3 (Sodium carbonate) + H2O +CO2
 
### Uses of Baking soda
* (i) For making baking powder
* (ii) An ingredient in antacids. Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and provides relief.
* (iii) In soda-acid fire extinguishers

### Baking powder
* A mixture of baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as tartaric acid. 
* When baking powder is heated or mixed in water, the following reaction takes place –
* NaHCO3 + H+  (From any acid) → CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid 
* Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or cake to rise making them soft and spongy.


## Washing soda
* Na2CO3.10H2O 
* Basic salt.
### Production
* Recrystallisation of sodium carbonate gives washing soda 
* Na2CO3 + 10H2O → Na2C02.10H20
### Uses
* (i) In glass, soap and paper industries.
* (ii) In the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.
* (iii) As a cleaning agent for domestic purposes.
* (iv) Removing permanent hardness of water
