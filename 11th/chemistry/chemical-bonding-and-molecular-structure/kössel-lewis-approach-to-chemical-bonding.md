# 4.1 KÖSSEL-LEWIS APPROACH TO CHEMICAL BONDING
* Based on the inertness of noble gases

### Lewis observations
* Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a positively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus the inner electrons) and the outer shell.
* Outer shell could  accommodate a maximum of eight electrons. 
* These eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube which surround the ‘Kernel’. 
* In sodium, a single outer shell electron would occupy one corner of the cube
* In case of a noble gas, all the eight corners would be occupied. 
* This octet of electrons, represents a particularly stable electronic arrangement 
* Lewis postulated that atoms achieve the stable octet when they are linked by chemical bonds.
### Lewis symbols
* The number of dots around the symbol represents the number of valence electrons. 
### Kössel observations
* In the periodic table, the highly electronegative halogens and the highly electropositive alkali metals are separated by the noble gases;
* The formation of a negative ion from a halogen atom and a positive ion from an alkali metal atom is associated with the gain and loss of an electron by the respective atoms;
* The negative and positive ions thus formed attain stable noble gas electronic configurations. 
* The noble gases (with the exception of helium which has a duplet of electrons) have a particularly stable outer shell configuration of eight (octet) electrons, ns2np6.
* The negative and positive ions are stabilized by electrostatic attraction.
* The bond formed, as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the positive and negative ions was termed as the electrovalent bond. 
#### Limitations
* Works for ionic compounds, but does not work for other compounds

## Electronic theory of chemical bonding
* Atoms can combine to have an octet (8 electrons) in their outermost shells. 
* Can be achieved by (1) By transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) (2) By sharing of valence electrons
## 4.1.1 Octet Rule
* Atoms can combine to have an octet (8 electrons) in their outermost shells. 
* Can be achieved by (1) By transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) (2) By sharing of valence electrons
## 4.1.2 Covalent Bond
* Langmuir (1919) introduced the term covalent bond.
* Covalent bond is formed as a result of sharing of electrons between the atoms.
* Each combining atom contributes at least one electron to the shared pair.
* The combining atoms attain the outershell noble gas configurations as a result of the sharing of electrons.
* When two atoms share one electron pair they are said to be joined by a single covalent bond.
* If two atoms share two pairs of electrons, the covalent bond between them is called a double bond.
