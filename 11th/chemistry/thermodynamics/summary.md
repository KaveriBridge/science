## Thermodynamics
* Study of **energy transformation**
* Of **macroscopic systems** (large number of molecules)
* Not concerned about how and at what rate
* Based on **system's initial and final states**
* Applies only **in equilibrium** or from **one equilibrium state to another**

## Definition
### Thermodynamics
* Deals with **heat/work/temperature**
* Their **relation to energy/entropy/physical properties of matter and radiation**

|Term|Meaning|
|-|-|
|**System**|The part of the universe in which observations are made|
|**Surroundings**| Everything other than the system|
|**Universe** | The system + The surroundings |
|**Boundary** | The **wall** between the system from the surroundings |
|**Internal energy** (U) | The **sum of all the energy of the system** |
|**Free expansion**| Expansion of a gas in vacuum (Δw=0)|

### Types of the System
|Property|Energy exchange|Matter exchange|Example system|
|-|-|-|-|
|Open System     | ✔ | ✔  |Open beaker|
|Closed system   | ✔ | ❌ |Conducting closed vessel|
|Isolated system | ❌| ❌ |Thermos flask |

### Thermodynamic processes
|System|Property|Equation| Work done|
|-|-|-|-|
|Adiabatic process | No heat exchange |Δq=0| No simple equation|
|Isothermal process | Const temp |ΔT=0| Reversible: w = – 2.303 nRT log (Vf/Vi) <br> Irreversible:  w = -p<sub>ex</sub>ΔV
|Isobaric process | Const pressure |Δp=0| w = -p<sub>ex</sub>ΔV 
|Isochoric process | Const volume |ΔV=0| w = 0

### Specifying state of system and its sorroundings
|  | Description
|-|-|
|System | Specified by  **state functions** or **state variables**
|Sorroundings | Cannot be completely specified

| Variable | Description| Examples|
|-|-|-|
|State function/variable| Depend only on state <br> and not on how it is reached. | Pressure, Volume, Temperature, Internal energy | 
|Path variable |Depends on the path used to reach | Heat, Work|

### Signs (IUPAC vs Physics)
| Type | IUPAC sign | Physics sign|
|-|-|-|
|Work done **by the system** | -ve | +ve|
|Work done **on the system** | +ve | -ve|
|Heat transferred **to the system**|+ve|?|
|Heat transferred **by the system**|-ve|?|

### Reversible vs Irreversible process
#### Reversible process
* The process could, at any moment, be reversed by an infinitesimal change. 
* Proceeds infinitely slowly by a series of equilibrium states 
* The system and the surroundings are always in near equilibrium with each other.

## First Law of Thermodynamic System
* **The energy of an isolated system is constant**
* aka the law of conservation of energy (**energy can neither be created nor be destroyed**)
* **∆U** (change in internal energy) = **q** (heat added to the system) + **w** (work done on the system)

## Enthalpy
* **H** (Enthapy) = **U** (Internal energy) **+ pV** (pressure x volume)
### Various conditions
|System|Equation|
|-|-|
|Constant pressure (∆p=0) |∆H = ∆U + p∆V |
|Constant volume (∆V=0)|∆H = ∆U |
|Constant temperature (∆T=0) |∆H = ∆U + ∆n<sub>g</sub>RT |

### ∆H for Exothermic and Endothermic 
|Type of system|∆H|
|-|-|
|Exothermic | Negative (-ve)
|Endothermic | Positive (+ve)
