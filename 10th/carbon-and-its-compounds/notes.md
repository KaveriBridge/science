## Introduction
* Carbon is a versatile and an important element. 
* Food, clothes, medicines, book are all based on carbon. All living structures are carbon based. 
* Earth has only small amount of carbon - 0.02% in earth's crust in the form of minerals and 0.03% CO2 in the atmosphere. 

## BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND

### Covalent vs Ionic bonds
|Properties|Ionic compounds|Covalent compounds|

|Boiling point|High|Low|
|Conducting ability | Conducts in solution or in the molten state | Poor Conductors |

## Covalent Bonds
### Hydrogen
* Hydrogen has one electron in its K shell
* It requires one more electron to fill the K shell. 
* Two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H₂
* Each hydrogen atom attains the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, helium, which has two electrons in its K shell.

### Oxygen
* Oxygen has the atomic number 8.
* An atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell.
* It requires two more electrons to complete its octet. 
* Each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen
* In other words, the two atoms form a double bond between them

### Nitrogen
* Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. 
* In order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared pairs of electrons. 
* This is said to constitute a triple bond between the two atoms.

### Methane
* Methane has a formula CH4. 
* Hydrogen has a valency of 1 (and needs one electron). 
* Carbon has a valency of 4 (and needs four electrons).
* In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen

## Covalent bonds and their properties
* They are the bonds formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms 

### Why do covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points?
* They have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-molecular (between two molecules) forces are weak. 
* Therefore, they have low melting and boiling points. 

### Why are covalent compounds poor conductors of electricity?
* In covalent bonds, the electrons are shared between atoms and no charged particles are formed
* As a result, they are poor conductors of electricity.

## VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON
### Why is Carbon considered versatile?
* Unlike any other element, carbon can form millions of compounds. 

### Why carbon does not form ionic bonds? Why does it form covalent bonds instead?
* Elements forming ionic compounds either gain or lose electrons from the outermost shell. 
* The atomic number of carbon is 6.
* It has four electrons in its outermost shell
* It needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration.
* It could gain four electrons forming C⁴⁻ anion. 
   * But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.
* It could lose four electrons forming C⁴⁺ cation. 
   * But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons
* Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements.

### Why can carbon form strong covalent bonds?
* One of the reasons is the small size of carbon.
* This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. 
* The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are much weaker

### Why can carbon form so many compounds?
* There are two reasons (i) Catenation (ii) Tetravalency

### CATENATION
#### What is catenation?
* Ability to form bonds with other atoms of the same element, giving rise to large molecules.
#### Carbon can form strong bonds with other carbon atoms
* Carbon can form bonds with other carbon atoms, giving rise to large molecules. 
* The bonds can be single, double or triple bonds. 
* The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. 
* This can be long chains of carbon,  branched chains and even  rings.
* No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. 
* Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. 
* This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other

### TETRAVALENCY
* Carbon has a valency of four
* It can bond with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. 
* It is known to bond with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements
* The properties of these compounds depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.
* The bonds formed with most other elements are very strong, and hence the compounds are exceptionally stable. 


## Saturated and Unsaturated Carbons
### Saturated compounds
* Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.
### Unsaturated compounds
* Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.

## Formation of coal and petroleum
### Coal
* Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived millions of years ago. 
* These were crushed into the earth, perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 
* They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. 
* They slowly decayed into coal. 

### Oil and gas
* Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. 
* When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. 
* Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. 
* Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. 
* The oil and gas seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. 

## Oxidation
* Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate oxidise alcohols to acids. 
* Oxidation of Ethanol
  * Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube.
  * Warm it gently in a water bath.
  * Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate drop by drop to this solution.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate disappears initially.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added.

    Saturated/Unsaturated fats and health        
        Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains
        Animal fats have saturated carbon chains    
        Saturated fats are harmul for health
        Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.
