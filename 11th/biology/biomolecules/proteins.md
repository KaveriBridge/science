## Proteins
* Polypeptides -  linear chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds
* Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.
* Proteins can have 20 types of amino acids
* Heteropolymer - Can be made of different amino acid (unlike homopolymer)
* Functions - Transport nutrients across cell membrane, Fight infectious organisms, Hormones, Enzymes

## Abundance
* Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world 
* Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere

## Proteins and their function
|Protein |Functions|
|-|-|
|Collagen |Intercellular ground substance
|Trypsin |Enzyme
|Insulin |Hormone
|Antibody| Fights infectious agents
|Receptor| Sensory reception (smell, taste, hormone, etc.)
|GLUT-4| Enables glucose transport into cells

## Amino acids
* Building block of proteins
### Components
<img width="320" src="http://www.astrochem.org/sci_img/Amino_Acid_Structure.jpg">

* −NH₂ (Amino group)
* −COOH (Carboxyl group)
* −R group, which is different for different amino acids

### Acid, Neutral or Base
* Depends on the number of amino and carboxyl groups
* Acidic (e.g., glutamic acid)
* Basic (lysine)
* Neutral (valine) amino acids. 

### Structure and pH
* Structure of amino acids changes depending on the pH
* Due to the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups

### Aromatic amino acids
* Aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan

### Types of amino acids
|Name | R group | Description | 
|-|-|-|
|Glycine | Hydrogen (-H) |
|Alanine | Methyl (-CH₃)|
|Serine  | Hydroxy methyl (-CH₂-OH)|
|Lysine  | Lysl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) | Basic |

### Essential and Non-Essential Amino acids
* Essential amino acids cannot be made in human body and hence has to be part of the diet.
