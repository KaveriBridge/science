### Metabolism
* The set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. 
* The three main purposes of metabolism are: 
    * the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run cellular processes; 
    * the conversion of food to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates
    * the elimination of metabolic wastes. 

### Metabolic pathway 
* A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions in a cell that build and breakdown molecules for cellular processes.

### Anabolic and Catabolic pathways
* Anabolic pathways synthesize molecules and require energy. Example - Assembly of a protein.
* Catabolic pathways break down molecules and produce energy. Example - Breakdown of glucose to lactic acid
* Enzymes facilitate these chemical reactions.

### ATP
* Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
* Living organisms store energy in the bonds of ATP 
* They use this bond energy for work, when needed.

### Living and Metabolism
#### The living state is a non-equilibrium steady-state to be able to perform work.
* All living organisms exist in a steady-state characterised by concentrations of various biomolecules.
* The steady state not an equilibrium state.
* Any chemical or physical process moves spontaneously to equilibrium. 
* Systems at equilibrium cannot perform work.
* Living process is a constant effort to prevent falling into equilibrium. 
* This is achieved by energy input, provided by metabolism
* Without metabolism there cannot be a living state.
