## Structural Isomerism
* Same molecular formula but different structures (manners in which atoms are linked)

### Chain isomerism
* Similar molecular formula but different carbon skeletons

### Position isomerism
* Differ in the position of substituent atom or functional group on the carbon skeleton

### Functional group isomerism
* Same molecular formula but different functional groups

### Metamerism
* Different alkyl chains on either side of the functional group in the molecule. 

## Stereoisomerism
* Same constitution and sequence of covalent bonds 
* Different in relative positions of their atoms or groups in space

### Geometrical isomerism
### Optical isomerism
