## Introduction
* The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror. 
**Spherical Mirror*** A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors with spherical reflecting surfaces are called spherical mirrors.

## Concave vs Convex Mirror
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards. 
* **Concave Mirror**A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
* **Convex Mirror**: A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror.

## Terms
### Pole
* The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror
* Lies on the surface of the mirror
* Usually represented by the letter P.

## Centre of Curvature
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere. 
* The centre of this sphere is a point called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. 
* Represented by the letter C. 
### Where does it lie?
* It is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting surface. 
* Concave Mirror: Lies in front of the concave mirror.
* Convex Mirror:  Lies behind of the convex mirror.

## Radius of Curvature
* The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. 
* Represented by the letter R. 
* The distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. 
## Principal axis
* An imaginary line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror. 
* The pincipal axis is normal to the mirror at its pole. 

# Principal Focus
* A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a spherical mirror. 
* Observe the reflected rays.

* In case of a concave mirror, the reflected rays are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the mirror.

* In case of a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to come from a point on the principal axis. 

* This point is called the principal focus of the mirror. 
* The principal focus is represented by the letter F. 

## Focal length
* The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length. 
* Represented by the letter f
