## Magnetism due to electricity 
* The electric current through the copper wire produces a magnetic effect. 
* Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric current through a metallic conductor

## Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
* In 1820, he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
* Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. 
* The unit of magnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.


## Compass needle
* A compass needle is a small bar magnet. 
* The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards north and south directions. 
* The end pointing towards north is called north seeking or north pole. 
* The other end that points towards south is called south seeking or south pole. 
* Like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other

## Magnetic field and field lines
* Magnetic field has both direction and magnitude.
* Magnetic field lines are closed curves.
* They emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole 
* Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. 
* The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. 
* The field is stronger, that is, the force acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded 
* No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.

### Strength of the magnetic field
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it.


### Right-Hand Thumb Rule

* Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. 
* Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field
* This is known as the right-hand thumb rule
* Also known as "Maxwell’s corkscrew rule"

## Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop
* We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines produced around a current-carrying straight wire. 
* Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it. 
* How would the magnetic field lines look like? 
* We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it. 
* Similarly at every point of a current-carrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move
away from the wire 
* By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. 
* Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. 
* By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop
* We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
* Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. 
* This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up.

## Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid
* A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. 
* One end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the south pole. 
* The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. 
* Magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. It is uniform inside the solenoid.

## Electromagnet
* A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron, when placed inside the coil 
* The magnet so formed is called an electromagnet.
