* Reproductive processes produce new individuals with subtle differences
* Asexual reproduction can produce some variation
* Sexual reproduction maximizes the number of successful variations
* Little variation among individual sugarcane plants, but distinct variations among sexually reproducing animals like humans
* This chapter will study the mechanism of creating and inheriting variations, and the long-term consequences of these variations, including evolution
