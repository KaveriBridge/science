* Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. 
### Nitrogen bases
* Some of these are nitrogen bases â€“ adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. 
### Nucleosides
* When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. 
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 
### Nucleotides
* If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. 
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. 
* DNA and RNA function as genetic material.
