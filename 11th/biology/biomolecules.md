## What is refraction?
* A ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium.
* Refraction is due to change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to another. 

## Effects of refraction
* The bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised
* Letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it
* When a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. 
* A pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water.  
* A lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides.
