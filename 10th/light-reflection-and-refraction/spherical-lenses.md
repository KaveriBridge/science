## Introduction
## What is a lens?
* A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. 
* A lens is bound by at least one spherical surface. The other could be plane. 

## Convex Lens
* A lens may have two spherical surfaces, bulging outwards. 
* Such a lens is called a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex lens. 
* It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges. 
* Convex lens converges light rays as shown in the figure and hence called converging lenses.

## Concave Lens
* A double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces, curved inwards. 
* A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens
* It is thicker at the edges than at the middle. 
* Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in the figure and hence called diverging lenses.

### Optical centre
* The central point of a lens is its optical centre
* Usually represented by the letter O.
* A ray of light through the optical centre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. 

### Centre of Curvature
* A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens, has two spherical surfaces. 
* Each of these surfaces forms a part of a sphere. 
* The centres of these spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens. 
* The centre of curvature of a lens is usually represented by the letter C. 
* Since there are two centres of curvature, we may represent them as C1  and C2

### Radius of Curvature
* The radius of the sphere of which the spherical surface of a spherical lens forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the lens. 
* Represented by the letter R. 

### Aperture
* The effective diameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.

### Thin lenses with small apertures
* Aperture is much less than its radius of curvature
* Two centres of curvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. 

### Principal axis
* An imaginary straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is called its principal axis.
* It passes through the optical centre.

### Principal Focus
* A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a spherical lens. 
* Observe the refracted rays.

* In case of a convex lens, the refracted rays are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the lens.

* In case of a convex mirror, the refracted rays appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis. 
* This point is called the principal focus of the lens. 
* The principal focus is represented by the letter F. 
* If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you get another principal focus on the opposite side.  Hence, a lens has two principal foci. They
are represented by F1  and F2

### Focal length
* The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. 
* Represented by the letter f

### radius of curvature R, and focal length f
* R = 2f
* The principal focus (F) of a spherical lens lies midway between the optical center (O) and the centre of curvature (C).

## Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors
### Ray Diagrams
#### Ray parallel to the principal axis

A ray parallel to the principal axis, after reflection, will pass through the principal focus in case of a concave mirror or appear to diverge from the principal focus in case of a convex mirror.

#### Ray passing through to the principal focus
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209050-6374a341-9da3-4297-9980-325348825b20.png">
A ray passing through the principal focus of a concave mirror or a ray which is directed towards the principal focus of a convex mirror, after reflection, will emerge parallel to the principal axis. 

#### Ray passing through to the centre of curvature
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209094-7e2224c3-e5a3-406d-87f6-f6d0f6d84082.png">
A ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or directed in the direction of the centre of curvature of a convex mirror, after reflection, is reflected back along the same path. The light rays come back along the same path because the incident rays fall on the mirror along the normal to the reflecting surface  

#### Ray incident obliquely to the principal axis towards at the pole of the mirror
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148209128-ed2c65bf-4d91-43f3-82d2-9e868425db69.png">
A ray incident obliquely to the principal axis, towards a point P (pole of the mirror), on the concave mirror or a convex mirror, is reflected obliquely. The incident and reflected rays follow the laws of reflection at the point of incidence (point P), making equal angles with the principal axis.

## Usage
### Convex Mirrors
* As rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles. 
* These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. 

Why?
  * They always give an erect, though diminished, image. 
  * They have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. 
  * Enables the driver to view much larger area than would be possible with a plane mirror.

### Concave Mirrors
* In torches, search-lights and vehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. 
* As shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. 
* By dentists to see large images of the teeth of patients. 
* In solar furnaces, to concentrate sunlight to produce heat.

## Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors
### New Cartesian Sign Convention
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148201657-284e968a-c505-4076-aa0b-a69a28a5eec6.png">

|Topic|Convention|
|-|-|
|Origin|The pole (P) of the mirror
|x-axis|The principal axis of the mirror
|Object| Always placed to the left of the mirror. 
|Distance | All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror
|Distance sign |  Distances measured to the right of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as positive <br> Distances measured to the left of the origin (along +x-axis) are taken as negative <br> Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along + y-axis) are taken as positive. <br> Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along –y-axis) are taken as negative.

## Mirror Formula

* u = object distance = The distance of the object from the pole of the mirror
* v = image distance = The distance of the image from the pole of the mirror 
* f = focal length = The distance of the principal focus from the pole

## Magnification
* Magnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.
* Ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. 
* Represented by the letter m

### Formula
* m = Height of the image/ Height of the object = h′/h
* m = h'/h = -v/u

<img width="320" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/148212662-f79c3912-af01-4b92-a87f-5b83108705d5.png">

### Sign of the height
* The height of the object is taken to be positive as the object is usually placed above the principal axis. 
* The height of the image should be taken as positive for virtual images. 
* The height of the image should be taken as negative for real images

### Sign of the magnification
* Negative for real images
* Positive for virtual images
