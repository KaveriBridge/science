## 14.2.1 Fossil Fuels
* In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. 
* The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. 
* Can you think of some of these uses? 
* The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. 
* Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. 
* It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. 
* The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels â€“ coal and petroleum. 
* Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. 
* But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. 
#### Disadvantages
* Non-renewable source of energy
* Air pollution due to burning of coal or petroleum products
* Acid rain - The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. 
* Green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.
