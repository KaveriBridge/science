## Biomolecule
* Molecules present in organisms that are essential to one or more typically biological processes, such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.
* Includes large macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids
* Includes small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products.

### Large vs small molecules

|Property| Micromolecules | Lipids | Other macromolecules|
|-|-|-|-|
|Molecular weights| 18-800 daltons | < 1000 dalton | > 1000 dalton | 
|Examples ||Fatty acids, Glycerides, Glycerol| Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids|
|Solubility | Acid Soluble | Acid Insoluble | Acid Insoluble |
||Monomer|Neither|Polymer|

### Dehydration 
* Dehydration is the process of creating a bond between two molecules to create a new, larger molecule by taking one hydrogen from one molecule, and an OH from the other, creating one molecule of free water.


## Lipids

* Lipids are generally water insoluble. 
* They could be simple fatty acids. 

### Fatty acids
* R-COOH 
* COOH → carboxyl group
* R → methyl (–CH₃), or ethyl (–C₂H₅) or higher number of –CH₂ groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). 
* Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds).

### Glycerol
* Trihydroxy propane.

### Glycerides 
* They are esters of glycerol and fatty acids
* They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. 
* These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. 
* Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. 

### Phospholipids
* Lipids with phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
* They are found in cell membrane. 
* Example: Lecithin


## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES
### Metabolite
* A metabolite is an intermediate or end product of metabolism. 
### Primary metabolite 
* Directly involved in normal "growth", development, and reproduction. 
* Example - Ethylene 
### Secondary metabolite 
* Not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function. 
* Examples - alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. 

## 9.8 NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER
### Moeity
* A fragment of a molecule, especially the one that comprises an identifiable unit 
* E.g. an acetyle group
### Protein
* In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond
* Formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NH2) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration).
### Sugar
* In a polysaccharide, the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. 
* This bond is formed by dehydration. 
* This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides.

### Metabolism
* The set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. 
* The three main purposes of metabolism are: 
    * the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run cellular processes; 
    * the conversion of food to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates
    * the elimination of metabolic wastes. 

### Metabolic pathway 
* A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions in a cell that build and breakdown molecules for cellular processes.

### Anabolic and Catabolic pathways
* Anabolic pathways synthesize molecules and require energy. Example - Assembly of a protein.
* Catabolic pathways break down molecules and produce energy. Example - Breakdown of glucose to lactic acid
* Enzymes facilitate these chemical reactions.

### ATP
* Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
* Living organisms store energy in the bonds of ATP 
* They use this bond energy for work, when needed.
