## Introduction
* The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror. 
**Spherical Mirror*** A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors with spherical reflecting surfaces are called spherical mirrors.

## Concave vs Convex Mirror
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards. 
* **Concave Mirror**A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
* **Convex Mirror**: A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror.

* The shaded side is non-reflecting

## Terms
### Pole
* The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror
* Lies on the surface of the mirror
* Usually represented by the letter P.

## Centre of Curvature
* The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.
* This sphere has a centre. 
* This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. 
* It is represented by the letter C. 
* The centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. 
* It lies outside its reflecting surface. 
* The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.
* It lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror.
