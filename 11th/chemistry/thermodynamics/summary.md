## Thermodynamics
* Chemical energy stored by molecules can be released as heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane, cooking gas or coal burns in air. 
* The chemical energy may also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like dry cell. 
* Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may be transformed from one form into another. 
* The study of these energy transformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics.
* The laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules rather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules.
* Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and final states of a system undergoing the change. 
* Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state. 
* Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. 

In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important questions through thermodynamics, like: 
* How do we determine the energy changes involved in a chemical reaction/process? 
* Will it occur or not?
* What drives a chemical reaction/process?
* To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?


## Definition
### Thermodynamics
* A branch of physics 
* Deals with heat, work, and temperature, 
* And their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation.

## 6.1 THERMODYNAMIC TERMS
### 6.1.1 The System and the Surroundings
* A system in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. 
* The surroundings include everything other than the system. 
* System and the surroundings together constitute the universe .
* The universe = The system + The surroundings
* However, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. 
* Therefore, for all practical purposes, the surroundings are that portion of the remaining universe which can interact with the system.
* Usually, the region of space in the neighbourhood of the system constitutes its surroundings.
* For example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 6.1).
* Note that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. 
* It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. 
* The wall that separates the system from the surroundings is called boundary. 
* This is designed to allow us to control and keep track of all movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.
### Types of the System
|Property|Open System|Closed system|Isolated system|
|-|-|-|-|
|Exchange of energy | ✔ | ✔  |❌|
|Exchange of matter | ✔ | ❌ |❌|

#### Open System
* Exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings
* Example: Reactants in an open beaker
#### Closed System
* No exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings
* Example: Reactants in a closed vessel made of conducting material
#### Isolated System
* No exchange of energy or matter between the system and the surroundings.
* Example: Reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel

### Thermodynamic processes
* Adiabatic process: A thermodynamic process that transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. The system exchanges no heat or matter with its surroundings.
* Isothermal process: A thermodynamic process in which the temperature T of a system remains constant: ΔT = 0.
