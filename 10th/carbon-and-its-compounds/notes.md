## Introduction
* Carbon is a versatile and an important element. 
* Food, clothes, medicines, book are all based on carbon. All living structures are carbon based. 
* Earth has only small amount of carbon - 0.02% in earth's crust in the form of minerals and 0.03% CO2 in the atmosphere. 


## Covalent Bonds
### What are covalent bonds?
* They are the bonds formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms.
* Unlike ionic bonds, charges are not formed with covalent bonds.

### Covalent vs Ionic bonds
|Properties|Ionic compounds|Covalent compounds|
|-|-|-|
|Melting point|High|Low|
|Boiling point|High|Low|
|Conducting ability | Conducts in solution or in the molten state | Poor Conductors |

### Why do covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points?
* They have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-molecular (between two molecules) forces are weak. 
* Therefore, they have low melting and boiling points. 

### Why are covalent compounds poor conductors of electricity?
* In covalent bonds, the electrons are shared between atoms and no charged particles are formed
* As a result, they are poor conductors of electricity.


## Covalent Bonds - Examples

### Hydrogen molecule
* Hydrogen has one electron in its K shell
* It requires one more electron to fill the K shell. 
* Two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H₂
* Each hydrogen atom attains the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, helium, which has two electrons in its K shell.

### Oxygen molecule
* Oxygen has the atomic number 8.
* An atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell.
* It requires two more electrons to complete its octet. 
* Each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen
* In other words, the two atoms form a double bond between them

### Nitrogen molecule
* Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. 
* In order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared pairs of electrons. 
* This is said to constitute a triple bond between the two atoms.

### Methane molecule
* Methane has a formula CH₄. 
* Hydrogen has a valency of 1 (and needs one electron). 
* Carbon has a valency of 4 (and needs four electrons).
* In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen

## Covalent bonds in Carbon
### Why carbon does not form ionic bonds? Why does it form covalent bonds instead?
* Elements forming ionic compounds either gain or lose electrons from the outermost shell. 
* The atomic number of carbon is 6.
* It has four electrons in its outermost shell
* It needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration.
* It could gain four electrons forming C⁴⁻ anion. 
   * But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.
* It could lose four electrons forming C⁴⁺ cation. 
   * But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons
* Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements.

### Why can carbon form strong covalent bonds?
* One of the reasons is the small size of carbon.
* This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. 
* The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are much weaker

## VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON
### Why is Carbon considered versatile?
* Unlike any other element, carbon can form millions of compounds. 

### Why can carbon form so many compounds?
* There are two reasons (i) Catenation (ii) Tetravalency

#### CATENATION - Carbon can form strong bonds with other carbon atoms
* Carbon can form bonds with other carbon atoms, giving rise to large molecules. 
* The bonds can be single, double or triple bonds. 
* The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. 
* This can be long chains of carbon,  branched chains and even  rings.
* No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. 
* Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. 
* This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other

#### TETRAVALENCY - Carbon can form strong bonds with atoms of other mono-valent elements
* Carbon has a valency of four
* It can bond with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. 
* It is known to bond with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements
* The properties of these compounds depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.
* The bonds formed with most other elements are very strong, and hence the compounds are exceptionally stable. 

### What is catenation?
* Ability to form bonds with other atoms of the same element, giving rise to large molecules.

## Structure of carbon compounds
### How to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds
* Step 1: Link the carbon atoms together with a single bond
* Step 2: Use the hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon
* Step 3: If the valencies are not satisifed, change some of the carbon bonds to double or tripe bonds.

### Ethane
* Molecular formula - C₂H₆

* Step 1: Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond

<img width="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/149622103-9ef66a46-d681-4973-939a-a58616531dc0.png">

* Step 2: Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:

### Ethene
* Molecular formula - C₂H₄

* Step 1: Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond

* Step 2: Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, so each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms giving:

* Step 3: one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied. This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the two carbons.

## Saturated and Unsaturated Carbons
### Saturated compounds
* Carbon compounds having single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.
* These compounds are normally not very reactive
* Example - Methane, Ethane
 
### Unsaturated compounds
* Carbon compounds having double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds 
* They are more reactive than the saturated carbon compounds
* Example - Ethene (double-bond), Ethyne (triple-bond)

## Functional groups
* In addition to hydrogen, carbon also forms bonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.
* In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these elements. 
* In such compounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom. 
* These heteroatoms are also present in some groups.
* These heteroatoms and the group containing these confer specific properties to the compound, regardless of the length and nature of the carbon chain and hence are called
functional groups. 

### Key functional groups
<img width="640" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/149623730-0220cb28-79a3-4d00-be2f-c97e2e385681.png">

### Homologous series 
* A series of compounds in which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a homologous series.
* Differ by CH₂ group.
* Example - CH₃OH, C₂H₅OH, C₃H₇OH and C₄H₉OH all belong to alchohol family.


## Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds
### Method
* (i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. 
* (ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix
* (iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the suffix of the functional group begins with a vowel, then the name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and adding the appropriate suffix. 
* (iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’.

## Formation of coal and petroleum
### Coal
* Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived millions of years ago. 
* These were crushed into the earth, perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 
* They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. 
* They slowly decayed into coal. 

### Oil and gas
* Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. 
* When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. 
* Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. 
* Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. 
* The oil and gas seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. 

## Oxidation
* Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate oxidise alcohols to acids. 
* Oxidation of Ethanol
  * Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube.
  * Warm it gently in a water bath.
  * Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate drop by drop to this solution.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate disappears initially.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added.
