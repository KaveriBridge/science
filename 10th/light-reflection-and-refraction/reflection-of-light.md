## Introduction
* Light is reflected from all surfaces. 
* A regular reflection takes place when light is incident on smooth, polished and regular surfaces

## Properties of the image formed by a plane mirror
* Image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. 
* The size of the image is equal to that of the object. 
* Image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. 
* Image is laterally inverted.

## Angle of incidence and angle of reflection

* After striking the mirror, the ray of light is reflected in another direction.
* **Incident ray**: The light ray, which strikes any surface, is called the **incident ray**. 
* **Reflected ray**: The ray that comes back from the surface after reflection is known as the **reflected ray**.
* **Normal**:  A line making an angle of 90º to the line representing the mirror at the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror. This line is known
as the **normal to the reflecting surface** at that point.
* **Angle of incidence**: The angle between the normal and incident ray is called the **angle of incidence (∠i)**. 
* **Angle of reflection**: The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the **angle of reflection (∠r)** 

## Laws of reflection
* (i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
* (ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
