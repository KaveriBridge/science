#### The name of a line drawn at 90° to the surface of a material is 
(A) Incident 
(B) Vertical
(C) Boundary
(D) Normal

Answer: The normal line is drawn at 90° to the surface. It is used to measure angles formed by light rays.

#### Which term is used to refer to an incoming ray?
(A) Incident 
(B) Refracted
(C) Reflected
(D) Normal

Answer: The incident ray is the incoming ray. The angle between the incident ray and the normal is the angle of incidence.

#### What happens to a light ray when it travels from water into air?
* It bends towards the normal
* It slows down
* It bends away from the normal

Answer: The light ray bends away from the normal because it passes into a less dense material and speeds up.

#### Which is densest - air, water or glass?
* Air
* Water
* Glass

Answer: Glass is denser than air or water. Light slows down when it enters glass from air or water.

#### A light ray passes from air into water at an angle of 30°. Which of these angles is likely to be the angle of refraction?
* 30°
* 22°
* 38°

Answer: The angle of refraction is 22°. The light ray slows down and bends towards the normal line.

#### The unit of power of lens is
* a. Metre         b. Centimeter         c. Diopter         d. M<sup>-1</sup>
* 
#### The radius of curvature of a lens is 20cm the focal length is
* a. 10cm         b. 20cm         c. 5cm         d. 40cm
