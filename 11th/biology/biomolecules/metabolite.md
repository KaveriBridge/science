## Metabolite
* An intermediate or end product of metabolism
* Usually a small molecule. 

### Plants
* Metabolites are compounds synthesized by plants for both essential functions, such as growth and development (primary metabolites), and specific functions, such as pollinator attraction or defense against herbivory (secondary metabolites).

### Industrial use
* Often used in industrial microbiology for the production of food, amino acids, and antibiotics.

## Primary vs Secondary metabolite

| Property| Primary | Secondary |
|-|-|-|
| Growth | Essential for growth, development, and reproduction | No direct role |
| In plants | In all plants | In some plants|
| Function | Core functions of an organism | Interaction with other organisms|
|Examples| Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,...  | Antibiotics, Resins,...|
|Formation| Typically formed during the growth phase | Typically formed during the end or near the stationary phase of growth

## Secondary metabolites
|Category|Examples|
|-|-|
|Pigments |Carotenoids, Anthocyanins,etc.
|Alkaloids |Morphine, Codeine, etc.
|Terpenoides| Monoterpenes, Diterpenes etc.
|Essential oils |Lemon grass oil, etc.
|Toxins |Abrin, Ricin
|Lectins| Concanavalin A
|Drugs| Vinblastin, curcumin, etc.
