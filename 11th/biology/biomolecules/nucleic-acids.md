## Nucleic acid
* Polynucleotide
* Building block is a nucleotide

## Nucleotide, Nucleoside and DNA/RNA

### Nitrogen bases
* Substituted purines - Adenine, Guanine
* Substituted pyrimidines - Uracil, Cytosine, and Thymine

### Nucleosides
* Nitrogen base + Sugar
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 

### Nucleotides
* Nitrogen base + Sugar + Phosphate group
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Building block of DNA and RNA, which function as genetic material.

#### Nucleotide Components
* Heterocyclic compound - Nitrogen bases - A, G, U, C or T
* Monosaccharide - Ribose (in RNA) or 2’deoxyribose (in DNA)
* Phosphoric acid or phosphate.

## Bonds
* A phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding nucleotide.
* Ester bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar
* As there is one such ester bond on either side, it is called phosphodiester bond.

## Double-helix model
* Also known as Watson-Crick model.
* Two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e., run in the opposite direction.
* Sugarphosphate-sugar chain backbone
* The nitrogen bases are projected more or less perpendicular to this backbone but face inside.
* A of one strand pairs with T of another strand - Two hydrogen bonds
* G of one strand pairs with C of another strand - Three hydrogen bonds

### Helical staircase
* Each strand appears like a helical staircase.
* Each step of ascent is represented by a pair of bases.
* At each step of ascent, the strand turns 36 .
* One full turn of the helical strand would involve ten steps or ten base pairs.
