### Extended body
* A system of particles.

# Rigid body
### Ideal rigid body
* A body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. 
* The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change.
### Real bodies
* Deform under the influence of forces - so strictly not rigid bodies.
* But in many situations the deformations are negligible.
* We can ignore that they warp, bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid.

## Motion of rigid body
|Type| Motion|
|-|-|
|Not pivoted or fixed | Pure translation or <br> A combination of translation and rotation.|
|Fixed in some way | Rotation about an fixed axis (e.g. a cieling fan) or <br> Rotation about a moving axis (e.g. oscillating table fan)|

### Translation
* All particles of the body have the same velocity.
### Rotation about a fixed axis
* Every particle of the body moves in a circle
* The circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis 
* The circle has its centre on the axis

# Centre of Mass
## System of particles
* A system of n particles, not necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in space
* The centre of mass of such a system is at (X, Y, Z )
