## Sodium hydroxide
* When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. 
* The process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
* 2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)
* Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode. 
* Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. 
* The three products produced in this process are all useful. 
* Figure 2.8 shows the different uses of these products.
## Bleaching powder
* Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. 
* Bleaching powder is represented as CaOCl2, though the actual composition is quite complex.
* Ca(OH)2 + Cl2 → CaOCl2 + H2O
### Bleaching powder is used –
* (i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry
* (i) for bleaching wood pulp in paper factories
* (i) for bleaching washed clothes in laundry
* (ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries
* (iii) to make drinking water free from germs.


## Baking soda
* The chemical name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). 
* It is produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.
* NaCl + H2O + CO2 + NH3 → NH4Cl (Ammonium chloride) + NaHCO3 (Sodium hydrogencarbonate)
* It is a mild non-corrosive basic salt. 
* The following reaction takes place when it is heated during cooking –
* 2NaHCO3 (Sodium hydrogencarbonate) → (Heating)→ Na2CO3 (Sodium carbonate) + H2O +CO2
 
### Uses of Baking soda
* (i) For making baking powder
* (ii) An ingredient in antacids. Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and provides relief.
* (iii) In soda-acid fire extinguishers

### Baking powder
* A mixture of baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as tartaric acid. 
* When baking powder is heated or mixed in water, the following reaction takes place –
* NaHCO3 + H+  (From any acid) → CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid 
* Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or cake to rise making them soft and spongy.


## Washing soda
* Na2CO3.10H2O 
* Basic salt.
### Production
* Recrystallisation of sodium carbonate gives washing soda 
* Na2CO3 + 10H2O → Na2C02.10H20
### Uses
* (i) In glass, soap and paper industries.
* (ii) In the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.
* (iii) As a cleaning agent for domestic purposes.
* (iv) Removing permanent hardness of water

## Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?
### Copper Suplhate
* Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of crystallisation. 
* When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the salt turns white. 
* If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue colour of the crystals reappears. 
* Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt. 
* Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate. 
* Chemical formula for hydrated copper sulphate is Cu SO4 . 5H2O. 
* Now you would be able to answer the question whether the molecule of Na2CO3 .10H2O is wet. 
### Gypsum
* One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum. 
* It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. 
* It has the chemical formula CaSO4 .2H2O. 
* Let us look into the use of this salt 
### Plaster of Paris 
* On heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO4.1/2H2O). 
* This is called Plaster of Paris, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting fractured bones in the right position. 
* Plaster of Paris is a white powder and on mixing with water, it changes to gypsum once again giving a hard solid mass. 
* CaSO .1/2 H2O (Plaster of Paris) + 1 1/2 H2O -> CaSO4 .2H2O (Gypsum)
* * Note that only half a water molecule is shown to be attached as water of crystallisation. 
* How can you get half a water molecule? 
* It is written in this form because two formula units of CaSO4  share one molecule of water.
* Plaster of Paris is used for making toys, materials for decoration and for making surfaces smooth. 
* Try to find out why is calcium sulphate hemihydrate called ‘Plaster of Paris’ ?
