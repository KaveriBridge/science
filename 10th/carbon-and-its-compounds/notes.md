## Introduction
* Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed are all based on this versatile element carbon. 
* All living structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. 
* The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide. 
* In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the importance of carbon seems to be immense. 



## BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND

### Covalent vs Ionic bonds
|Properties|Ionic compounds|Covalent compounds|
|-|-|-|
|Melting point|High|Low|
|Boiling point|High|Low|
|Conducting ability | Conducts in solution or in the molten state | Poor Conductors |

### Why carbon does not form ionic bonds? Why does it form covalent bond instead?
* Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. 
* The atomic number of carbon is 6.
* It has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration.
* It could gain four electrons forming C⁴⁻ anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.
* It could lose four electrons forming C⁴⁺ cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons
* Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements.


### Covalent Bonds
#### Hydrogen
* Hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron to fill the K shell. 
* Two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H₂
* Each hydrogen atom attains the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, helium, which has two electrons in its K shell.

#### Oxygen
* An atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two more electrons to complete its octet. 
* So each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen 
* The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to two shared pairs of electrons. 
* This is said to constitute a double bond between the two atoms.

#### Nitrogen
* Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. 
* In order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared pairs of electrons. 
* This is said to constitute a triple bond between the two atoms.

## Formation of coal and petroleum
### Coal
* Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived millions of years ago. 
* These were crushed into the earth, perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 
* They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. 
* They slowly decayed into coal. 

### Oil and gas
* Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. 
* When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. 
* Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. 
* Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. 
* The oil and gas seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. 

## Oxidation
* Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate oxidise alcohols to acids. 
* Oxidation of Ethanol
  * Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube.
  * Warm it gently in a water bath.
  * Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate drop by drop to this solution.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate disappears initially.
  * The colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added.

## Addition Reaction
    Addition
        Unsaturated hydrocarbons
        Add hydrogen
        In presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel
        To give saturated hydrocarbons

    Catalysts
        cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate
        without the reaction itself being affected

    Hydrogenation
        Addition of hydrogen to vegetable oils 
            Using a nicket catalyst
            produces saturated fats

    Saturated/Unsaturated fats and health        
        Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains
        Animal fats have saturated carbon chains    
        Saturated fats are harmul for health
        Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.

## Substitution Reaction
    Substitution reaction
        A reaction in which one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another
