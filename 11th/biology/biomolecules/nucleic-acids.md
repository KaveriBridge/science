### Nitrogen bases
* Substituted purines - Adenine, Guanine
* Substituted pyrimidines - Uracil, Cytosine, and Thymine

### Nucleosides
* Nitrogen base + Sugar
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 

### Nucleotides
* Nitrogen base + Sugar + Phosphate group
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Building block of DNA and RNA, which function as genetic material.

#### Nucleotide Components
* Heterocyclic compound - Nitrogen bases - A, G, U, C or T
* Monosaccharide - Ribose (in RNA) or 2â€™deoxyribose (in DNA)
* Phosphoric acid or phosphate.
