* Molecules present in organisms that are essential to one or more typically biological processes, such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.
* Includes large macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids
* Includes small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products.

### Dehydration 
* Dehydration is the process of creating a bond between two molecules to create a new, larger molecule by taking one hydrogen from one molecule, and an OH from the other, creating one molecule of free water.

## Amino acids
* Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH₂) and carboxylate (−COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.

* The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. 
* Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. 
* Aromatic amino acids - tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan

* A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

### Types of amino acids
* Number of amino acids that occur in proteins are only of twenty types. 

|Name | R group | Description | 
|-|-|-|
|Glycine | Hydrogen (-H) |
|Alanine | Methyl (-CH₃)|
|Serine  | Hydroxy methyl (-CH₂-OH)|
|Lysine  | Lysl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) | Basic |

## Lipids

* Lipids are generally water insoluble. 
* They could be simple fatty acids. 

### Fatty acids
* R-COOH 
* COOH → carboxyl group
* R → methyl (–CH₃), or ethyl (–C₂H₅) or higher number of –CH₂ groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). 
* Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds).

### Glycerol
* Trihydroxy propane.

### Glycerides 
* They are esters of glycerol and fatty acids
* They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. 
* These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. 
* Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. 

### Phospholipids
* Lipids with phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.
* They are found in cell membrane. 
* Example: Lecithin

## DNA and RNA

* Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. 
### Nitrogen bases
* Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. 
### Nucleosides
* When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. 
* Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. 
### Nucleotides
* If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. 
* Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. 
* Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. 
* DNA and RNA function as genetic material.

## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES
### Metabolite
* A metabolite is an intermediate or end product of metabolism. 
### Primary metabolite 
* Directly involved in normal "growth", development, and reproduction. 
* Example - Ethylene 
### Secondary metabolite 
* Not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function. 
* Examples - alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. 

## 9.8 NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER
### Moeity
* A fragment of a molecule, especially the one that comprises an identifiable unit 
* E.g. an acetyle group
### Protein
* In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond
* Formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NH2) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration).
### Sugar
* In a polysaccharide, the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. 
* This bond is formed by dehydration. 
* This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides.
### Nucleic acid
* In a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding nucleotide. 
* The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar is an ester bond. 
* As there is one such ester bond on either side, it is called phosphodiester bond.
* Nucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. 
* For example, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the famous Watson-Crick model. 
* This model says that DNA exists as a double helix. 
* The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e., run in the opposite direction. 
* The backbone is formed by the sugarphosphate-sugar chain. 
* The nitrogen bases are projected more or less perpendicular to this backbone but face inside. 
* A and G of one strand compulsorily base pairs with T and C, respectively, on the other strand
* There are two hydrogen bonds between A and T and three hydrogen bonds between G and C. 
* Each strand appears like a helical staircase.
* Each step of ascent is represented by a pair of bases. 
* At each step of ascent, the strand turns 36 . 
* One full turn of the helical strand would involve ten steps or ten base pairs. 
* Attempt drawing a line diagram.
* The pitch would be 34Å. 
* The rise per base pair would be 3.4Å. 
* This form of DNA with the above mentioned salient features is called BDNA. 

### Metabolism
* The set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. 
* The three main purposes of metabolism are: 
    * the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run cellular processes; 
    * the conversion of food to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates
    * the elimination of metabolic wastes. 

### Metabolic pathway 
* A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions in a cell that build and breakdown molecules for cellular processes.

### Anabolic and Catabolic pathways
* Anabolic pathways synthesize molecules and require energy. Example - Assembly of a protein.
* Catabolic pathways break down molecules and produce energy. Example - Breakdown of glucose to lactic acid
* Enzymes facilitate these chemical reactions.

### ATP
* Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
* Living organisms store energy in the bonds of ATP 
* They use this bond energy for work, when needed.
