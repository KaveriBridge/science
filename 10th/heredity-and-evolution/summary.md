## Introduction
* Reproductive processes produce new individuals with subtle differences
* Asexual reproduction can produce some variation
* Sexual reproduction maximizes the number of successful variations
* Little variation among individual sugarcane plants, but distinct variations among sexually reproducing animals like humans
* This chapter will study the mechanism of creating and inheriting variations, and the long-term consequences of these variations, including evolution

## 9.1 ACCUMULATION OF VARIATION DURING REPRODUCTION
* Inheritance from the previous generation provides both a common basic body design, and subtle changes in it, for the next generation. 
* Now think about what would happen when this new generation, in its turn, reproduces. 
* The second generation will have differences that they inherit from the first generation, as well as newly created differences (Fig. 9.1).
* Figure 9.1 would represent the situation if a single individual reproduces, as happens in asexual reproduction. 
* If one bacterium divides, and then the resultant two bacteria divide again, the four individual bacteria generated would be very similar. 
* There would be only very minor differences between them, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying. 
* However, if sexual reproduction is involved, even greater diversity will be generated, as we will see when we discuss the rules of inheritance
* Do all these variations in a species have equal chances of surviving in the environment in which they find themselves? 
* Obviously not. Depending on the nature of variations, different individuals would have different kinds of advantages. 
* Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive better in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier. 
* Selection of variants by environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as we will discuss in later sections.

### Summary
* Inheritance from the previous generation provides a common body design and subtle changes for the next generation
* The second generation will have differences inherited from the first generation and newly created differences
* In asexual reproduction, small differences may be generated due to DNA copying errors, but in sexual reproduction, greater diversity is created through the rules of inheritance
* Not all variations in a species have equal chances of surviving in their environment
* Variations that give an advantage to individuals will be more likely to survive and be passed on
* Selection of variants by environmental factors is the basis for evolutionary processes

## Properties of the image formed by a plane mirror
* Image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. 
* The size of the image is equal to that of the object. 
* Image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. 
* Image is laterally inverted.
