# KÖSSEL-LEWIS APPROACH TO CHEMICAL BONDING
* Based on the inertness of noble gases

### Lewis observations
* Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a positively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus the inner electrons) and the outer shell.
* Outer shell could  accommodate a maximum of eight electrons. 
* These eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube which surround the ‘Kernel’. 
* In sodium, a single outer shell electron would occupy one corner of the cube
* In case of a noble gas, all the eight corners would be occupied. 
* This octet of electrons, represents a particularly stable electronic arrangement 
* Lewis postulated that atoms achieve the stable octet when they are linked by chemical bonds.
### Lewis symbols
* The number of dots around the symbol represents the number of valence electrons. 
### Kössel observations
* In the periodic table, the highly electronegative halogens and the highly electropositive alkali metals are separated by the noble gases;
* The formation of a negative ion from a halogen atom and a positive ion from an alkali metal atom is associated with the gain and loss of an electron by the respective atoms;
* The negative and positive ions thus formed attain stable noble gas electronic configurations. 
* The noble gases (with the exception of helium which has a duplet of electrons) have a particularly stable outer shell configuration of eight (octet) electrons, ns2np6.
* The negative and positive ions are stabilized by electrostatic attraction.
* The bond formed, as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the positive and negative ions was termed as the electrovalent bond. 
#### Limitations
* Works for ionic compounds, but does not work for other compounds

## Electronic theory of chemical bonding
* Atoms can combine to have an octet (8 electrons) in their outermost shells. 
* Can be achieved by (1) By transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) (2) By sharing of valence electrons
## Octet Rule
* Atoms can combine to have an octet (8 electrons) in their outermost shells. 
* Can be achieved by (1) By transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another (gaining or losing) (2) By sharing of valence electrons
## Limitations of the Octet Rule
#### The incomplete octet of the central atom 
* In some compounds, the number of electrons surrounding the central atom is less than eight.
* Example - BF3
#### Odd-electron molecules 
* In molecules with an odd number of electrons, the octet rule is not satisfied for all the atoms
* Example - Nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide, NO2
#### The expanded octet 
* In some compounds, there are more than eight valence electrons.
* Example - PF5

## Covalent Bond
* Langmuir (1919) introduced the term covalent bond.
* Covalent bond is formed as a result of sharing of electrons between the atoms.
* Each combining atom contributes at least one electron to the shared pair.
* The combining atoms attain the outershell noble gas configurations as a result of the sharing of electrons.
## Lewis dot structures
* Provides a picture of bonding in molecules and ions in terms of the shared pairs of electrons and the octet rule.
### How to write?
#### Count the total number of valence electrons
* The total number of electrons required for writing the structures are obtained by adding the valence electrons of the combining atoms. 
* For anions, each negative charge would mean addition of one electron. 
* For cations, each positive charge would mean subtraction of one electron.
#### Write the skeletal structure
* In general the least electronegative atom occupies the central position in the molecule/ion. 
#### Distribute the electrons as bonding shared pairs
* Distribute the total number of electrons as bonding shared pairs between the atoms in proportion to the total bonds.
#### Remaining electrons becomes lone pairs.

## Formal Charge
* The formal charge of an atom in a polyatomic molecule or ion may be defined as the difference between the number of valence electrons of that atom in an isolated or free
state and the number of electrons assigned to that atom in the Lewis structure.
