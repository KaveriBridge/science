### Corrosion
* Corrosion is a process that causes damage to metal objects, such as car bodies, bridges, iron railings, and ships. 
* It occurs when metals are attacked by substances like moisture and acids
* It is commonly seen as the formation of a reddish-brown powder on iron, or a black coating on silver and a green coating on copper. 
* Corrosion, especially of iron, is a major problem that results in the need to spend a large amount of money each year to replace damaged metal.
### Rancidity
* When fats and oils are left for a long time, they can become rancid and change in smell and taste due to the process of oxidation. 
* Antioxidants are often added to foods containing fats and oils to prevent this from happening. 
* To slow down oxidation, it is helpful to store food in airtight containers. 
* Chips manufacturers often use gas such as nitrogen to flush bags of chips and prevent them from becoming oxidized.
