## Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
* In 1820, he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
* Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena. 
* The unit of magnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.


## Compass needle
* A compass needle is a small magnet. 
* The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards north and south directions. 
* The end pointing towards north is called north seeking or north pole. 
* The other end that points towards south is called south seeking or south pole. 
* Like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other

## Magnetic field and field lines
* A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected.
* It has both direction and magnitude.

### Field lines
* Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. 
* A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. 
* The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take.

### Properties of magnetic field lines
* Magnetic field lines are closed curves. 
* They emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole. 
* Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. 
* No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.
* The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness of the lines. 
 

### Strength of the magnetic field
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point **depends directly on the current** passing through it.
* Magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire **depends inversely on the distance** from it.


### Right-Hand Thumb Rule
<img width="360" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/152538105-8a3fb65d-3567-45e2-9fcb-e790c72193ba.png">

* Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. 
* Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field
* This is known as the right-hand thumb rule
* Also known as "Maxwell’s corkscrew rule"

## Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop
* At the center of the circular loop, the magnetic field appears as straight lines. 
* Every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop
* If there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn.

## Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid
* A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. 
* The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.
* One end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the south pole. 
* The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. 
* Magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. It is uniform inside the solenoid.

## Electromagnet
* An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. 
* Usuallys consists core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire.
* Widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, loudspeakers, MRI machines.

## FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
* A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.
* This happens because magnetic field is produced when current is passed through a conductor.
* Fleming's left-hand rule can be used to determine the direction of the force.

### Fleming left hand rule
When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field such that the direction of current is perpendicular to the magnetic field, it experiences a force

<img width="360" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/152539943-dcd39b9f-88ee-4319-8352-ec9b2e839215.png">

* According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular. 
* If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or
the force acting on the conductor.

## ELECTRIC MOTOR
* An electric motor is a rotating device that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy. 
* Electric motor is used as an important component in electric fans, refrigerators, mixers, washing machines, computers, MP3 players etc. 

### How does an electric motor work?
* An electric motor consists of a rectangular coil ABCD of insulated copper wire. The coil is placed between the two poles of a magnetic field such that the arm AB and CD are perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The ends of the coil are connected to the two halves P and Q of a split ring. The inner sides of these halves are insulated and attached to an axle. The external conducting edges of P and Q touch two conducting stationary brushes X and Y, respectively. 

<img width="480" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/152633394-9d256e70-fe73-474f-8f24-91ac59b18740.png">


* Current in the coil ABCD enters from the source battery through conducting brush X and flows back to the battery through brush Y. Notice that the current in arm AB of the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it flows from C to D, that is, opposite to the direction of current through arm AB. On applying Fleming’s left hand rule for the direction of force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. We find that the force acting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm CD pushes it upwards. Thus the coil and the axle O, mounted free to turn about an axis, rotate anti-clockwise. At half rotation, Q makes contact with the brush X and P with brush Y. Therefore the current in the coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. 

* A device that reverses the direction of flow of current through a circuit is called a commutator. In electric motors, the split ring acts as a commutator. The reversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two arms AB and CD. Thus the arm AB of the coil that was earlier pushed down is now pushed up and the arm CD previously pushed up is now pushed down. Therefore the coil and the axle rotate half a turn more in the same direction. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half rotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle.

### Commercial motors
The commercial motors use (i) an electromagnet in place of permanent magnet; (ii) large number of turns of the conducting wire in the current carrying coil; and (iii) a soft iron core on which the coil is wound. The soft iron core, on which the coil is wound, plus the coils, is called an armature. This enhances the power of the motor

## 13.5 ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
* The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced current in a coil placed in a region where the magnetic field changes with time. 
* The magnetic field may change due to a relative motion between the coil and a magnet placed near to the coil. 
* If the coil is placed near to a current-carrying conductor, the magnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the conductor or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. 
* The direction of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s right-hand rule.

### Faraday's experiments
In 1831, Faraday made an important breakthrough by discovering how a moving magnet can be used to generate electric current.

### Moving a bar magnet around a stationary coil
* Take a coil of wire AB having a large number of turns.
* Connect the ends of the coil to a galvanometer 
* Take a strong bar magnet and move its north pole towards the end B of the coil. 
* There is a momentary deflection in the needle of the galvanometer, say to the right. This indicates the presence of a current in the coil AB. 
* The deflection becomes zero the moment the motion of the magnet stops. 
* Now withdraw the north pole of the magnet away from the coil. 
* Now the galvanometer is deflected toward the left, showing that the current is now set up in the direction opposite to the first.

### Moving a coil around stationary magnet
* Place the magnet stationary at a point near to the coil, keeping its north pole towards the end B of the coil. 
* Galvanometer needle deflects toward the right when the coil is moved towards the north pole of the magnet. 
* Similarly the needle moves toward left when the coil is moved away.
* When the coil is kept stationary with respect to the magnet, the deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero.
* You can also check that if you had moved south pole of the magnet towards the end B of the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer would just be opposite to the previous case. When the coil and the magnet are both stationary, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. 
* It is, thus, clear from this activity that motion of a magnet with respect to the coil produces an induced potential difference, which sets up an induced electric current in the circuit

### Galvanometer
A galvanometer is an instrument that can detect the presence of a current in a circuit. The pointer remains at zero (the centre of the scale) for zero current flowing through it. It can deflect either to the left or to the right of the zero mark depending on the direction of current.

### Michael Faraday (1791–1867)
Michael Faraday was an experimental physicist. He had no formal education. He worked in a book-binding shop during his early years. He used to read books that came for binding. This way Faraday developed his interest in science. He got an opportunity to listen to some public lectures by Humphrey Davy of Royal Institute. He made careful notes of Davy’s lectures and sent them to Davy. Soon he was made an assistant in Davy’s laboratory at the Royal Institute. Faraday made several path-breaking discoveries that include electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis. Several universities conferred on him the honorary degrees but he turned down such honours. Faraday loved his
science work more than any honour

### Fleming's right hand rule

* Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand so that they are perpendicular to each other
* If the forefinger indicates the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb shows the direction of motion of conductor, then the middle finger will show the direction
of induced current.

## 13.6 ELECTRIC GENERATOR

A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It works on the basis of electromagnetic induction.

### Construction of a generator
In an electric generator, mechanical energy is used to rotate a conductor in a magnetic field to produce electricity.
* An electric generator consists of a rotating rectangular coil ABCD placed between the two poles of a permanent magnet. 
* The two ends of this coil are connected to the two rings R1  and R2. 
* The inner side of these rings are made insulated. 
* The two conducting stationary brushes B1 and B2 are kept pressed separately on the rings R1 and R2, respectively. 
* The two rings R1 and R2 are internally attached to an axle. 
* The axle may be mechanically rotated from outside to rotate the coil inside the magnetic field.
* Outer ends of the two brushes are connected to the galvanometer to show the flow of current in the given external circuit.

<img width="480" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20998959/152638663-e1bc7235-1d96-4299-b1ed-8f46a5a90db1.png">

When the axle attached to the two rings is rotated such that the arm AB moves up (and the arm CD moves down) in the magnetic field produced
by the permanent magnet. Let us say the coil ABCD is rotated clockwise in the arrangement shown in Fig. 13.19. By applying Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced currents are set up in these arms along the directions AB and CD. Thus an induced current flows in the direction ABCD. If there are larger numbers of turns in the coil, the current generated in each turn adds up to give a large current through the coil. This means that the current in the external circuit flows from B2 to B1. After half a rotation, arm CD starts moving up and AB moving down. As a result, the directions of the induced currents in both the arms change, giving rise to the net induced current in the direction DCBA. The current in the external circuit now flows from B1 to B2. Thus after every half rotation the polarity of the current in the respective arms changes. Such a current, which changes direction after equal intervals of time, is called an alternating current (abbreviated as AC). This device is called an AC generator.

### DC generator
To get a direct current (DC, which does not change its direction with time), a split-ring type commutator must be used. With this arrangement, one brush is at all times in contact with the arm moving up in the field, while the other is in contact with the arm moving down. We have seen the working of a split ring commutator in the case of an electric motor (see Fig. 13.15). Thus a unidirectional current is produced. The generator is thus called a DC generator.

### AC vs DC
* In case of direct current, the current always flows in one direction, whereas the alternating current reverses its direction periodically. 
* In India, the AC changes direction after every 1/100 second, that is, the frequency of AC is 50 Hz. 
* An important advantage of AC over DC is that electric power can be transmitted over long distances without much loss of energy.

## 13.7 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. 
### Red Live Wire and Black Neutral Wire
* One of the wires in this supply, usually with red insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive).
* The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. 
* The potential difference between the two is 220 V. 
### Green Earth Wire
* Green insulation
* Connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. 
#### Safety measure 
* All appliances with metallic body are connected to the earth wire
* In case of a leak, this provides a low-resistance path for the current.
* Prevents user from getting a severe shock

### Current circuits
* 15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as geysers, air coolers, etc. 
* 5 A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc.

### How are appliances connected?
* In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires. 
* Each appliance has a separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. 
* In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other. 

### Overloading occurs
* When the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact.
* Due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. 
* When too many appliances are connected to a single socket.

### Short-circuit
* Occurs when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. 
* The current in the circuit abruptly increases
* Fuse prevents damage by stopping the flow of high current. The wire in the fuse melts due to heating and breaks the circuit.

### Fuse
* Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to short-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.
