## Biomolecule
* Molecules present in organisms that are essential to one or more typically biological processes, such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.
* Includes large macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids
* Includes small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products.

### Large vs small molecules

|Property| Micromolecules | Lipids | Other macromolecules|
|-|-|-|-|
|Molecular weights| 18-800 daltons | < 1000 dalton | > 1000 dalton | 
|Examples ||Fatty acids, Glycerides, Glycerol| Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids|
|Solubility | Acid Soluble | Acid Insoluble | Acid Insoluble |
||Monomer|Neither|Polymer|

### Dehydration 
* Dehydration is the process of creating a bond between two molecules to create a new, larger molecule by taking one hydrogen from one molecule, and an OH from the other, creating one molecule of free water.

##  NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER
### Moeity
* A fragment of a molecule, especially the one that comprises an identifiable unit 
* E.g. an acetyle group
### Protein
* In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond
* Formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NH2) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration).
### Sugar
* In a polysaccharide, the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. 
* This bond is formed by dehydration. 
* This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides.
