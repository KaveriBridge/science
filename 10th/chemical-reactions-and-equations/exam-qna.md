### The chemical reaction that takes place between sodium sulphate and barium chloride is called double displacement reaction. Why? Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.
* There is an exchange of ions between the reactants sodium sulphate and barium chloride. 
* Na₂SO₄ + BaCl₂ → BaSO₄ + 2NaCl. 

### What is the type of chemical reaction in which quicklime is obtained by lime stone (calcium carbonate) ? Write a chemical equation for this reaction.
* Decomposition reaction or thermal decomposition reaction / endothermic reaction. 
* CaCO₃ (lime stone) →Heat→  CaO (quick lime)  + CO₂
