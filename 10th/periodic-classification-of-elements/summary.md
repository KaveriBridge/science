## Write the limitations of Mendeleev’s periodic table.
Limitations of Mendeleev’s classification :
* No fixed position was given to hydrogen
* No fixed position was given to isotopes of all elements
* The atomic masses from one element to the other do not increase in a regular manner
* It is not possible to predict how many elements could be discovered between two elements. 

## Write the two reasons for placing oxygen and sulphur in a same group of modern periodic table.
* They have same chemical properties. 
* They have same valence electrons / they have similar electronic configuration in outermost shell. 

## Which one of the elements (oxygen and sulphur) has larger atomic size and why? 
(Atomic number of oxygen = 8, Atomic number of sulphur = 16)
* Sulphur has larger atomic size because atomic size increases down the group / New shells are being added as we go down the group. 
* This increases the distance between outermost electron and the nucleus.
